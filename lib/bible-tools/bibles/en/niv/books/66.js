			"3": "<sup>3</sup> You have persevered and have endured hardships for my name, and have not grown weary.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> Yet I hold this against you: You have forsaken the love you had at first.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> Consider how far you have fallen! Repent and do the things you did at first. If you do not repent, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place.",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> But you have this in your favor: You hate the practices of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who is victorious, I will give the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.",

			"21": "<sup>21</sup> I have given her time to repent of her immorality, but she is unwilling.",
			"22": "<sup>22</sup> So I will cast her on a bed of suffering, and I will make those who commit adultery with her suffer intensely, unless they repent of her ways.",
			"23": "<sup>23</sup> I will strike her children dead. Then all the churches will know that I am he who searches hearts and minds, and I will repay each of you according to your deeds.",
			"24": "<sup>24</sup> Now I say to the rest of you in Thyatira, to you who do not hold to her teaching and have not learned Satan’s so-called deep secrets, ‘I will not impose any other burden on you,",
			"25": "<sup>25</sup> except to hold on to what you have until I come.’",
