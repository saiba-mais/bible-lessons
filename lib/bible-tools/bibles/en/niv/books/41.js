			"1": "<sup>1</sup> John the Baptist Prepares the Way\nThe beginning of the good news about Jesus the Messiah, the Son of God,",
			"2": "<sup>2</sup> as it is written in Isaiah the prophet:\n“I will send my messenger ahead of you,\nwho will prepare your way”—",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> “a voice of one calling in the wilderness,\n‘Prepare the way for the Lord,\nmake straight paths for him.’”",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> And so John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> John wore clothing made of camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> And this was his message: “After me comes the one more powerful than I, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> The Baptism and Testing of Jesus\nAt that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> Just as Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> And a voice came from heaven: “You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.”",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> At once the Spirit sent him out into the wilderness,",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> and he was in the wilderness forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and angels attended him.",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> Jesus Announces the Good News\nAfter John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God.",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> “The time has come,” he said. “The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!”",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> Jesus Calls His First Disciples\nAs Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> “Come, follow me,” Jesus said, “and I will send you out to fish for people.”",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> At once they left their nets and followed him.",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> When he had gone a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat, preparing their nets.",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> Without delay he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.",
			"21": "<sup>21</sup> Jesus Drives Out an Impure Spirit\nThey went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.",
			"22": "<sup>22</sup> The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law.",
			"23": "<sup>23</sup> Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an impure spirit cried out,",
			"24": "<sup>24</sup> “What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”",
			"25": "<sup>25</sup> “Be quiet!” said Jesus sternly. “Come out of him!”",
			"26": "<sup>26</sup> The impure spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek.",
			"27": "<sup>27</sup> The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, “What is this? A new teaching—and with authority! He even gives orders to impure spirits and they obey him.”",
			"28": "<sup>28</sup> News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee.",
			"29": "<sup>29</sup> Jesus Heals Many\nAs soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew.",
			"30": "<sup>30</sup> Simon’s mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they immediately told Jesus about her.",
			"31": "<sup>31</sup> So he went to her, took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her and she began to wait on them.",
			"32": "<sup>32</sup> That evening after sunset the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed.",
			"33": "<sup>33</sup> The whole town gathered at the door,",
			"34": "<sup>34</sup> and Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was.",
			"35": "<sup>35</sup> Jesus Prays in a Solitary Place\nVery early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed.",
			"36": "<sup>36</sup> Simon and his companions went to look for him,",
			"37": "<sup>37</sup> and when they found him, they exclaimed: “Everyone is looking for you!”",
			"38": "<sup>38</sup> Jesus replied, “Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby villages—so I can preach there also. That is why I have come.”",
			"39": "<sup>39</sup> So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.",
			"40": "<sup>40</sup> Jesus Heals a Man With Leprosy\nA man with leprosy came to him and begged him on his knees, “If you are willing, you can make me clean.”",
			"41": "<sup>41</sup> Jesus was indignant. He reached out his hand and touched the man. “I am willing,” he said. “Be clean!”",
			"42": "<sup>42</sup> Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cleansed.",
			"43": "<sup>43</sup> Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning:",
			"44": "<sup>44</sup> “See that you don’t tell this to anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.”",
			"45": "<sup>45</sup> Instead he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere."

			"1": "<sup>1</sup> Jesus Forgives and Heals a Paralyzed Man\nA few days later, when Jesus again entered Capernaum, the people heard that he had come home.",
			"2": "<sup>2</sup> They gathered in such large numbers that there was no room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the word to them.",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> Some men came, bringing to him a paralyzed man, carried by four of them.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus by digging through it and then lowered the mat the man was lying on.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, “Son, your sins are forgiven.”",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> Now some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to themselves,",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> “Why does this fellow talk like that? He’s blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?”",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to them, “Why are you thinking these things?",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> Which is easier: to say to this paralyzed man, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up, take your mat and walk’?",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.” So he said to the man,",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> “I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home.”",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> He got up, took his mat and walked out in full view of them all. This amazed everyone and they praised God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this!”",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> Jesus Calls Levi and Eats With Sinners\nOnce again Jesus went out beside the lake. A large crowd came to him, and he began to teach them.",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> As he walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector’s booth. “Follow me,” Jesus told him, and Levi got up and followed him.",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> While Jesus was having dinner at Levi’s house, many tax collectors and sinners were eating with him and his disciples, for there were many who followed him.",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw him eating with the sinners and tax collectors, they asked his disciples: “Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?”",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> On hearing this, Jesus said to them, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> Jesus Questioned About Fasting\nNow John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. Some people came and asked Jesus, “How is it that John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees are fasting, but yours are not?”",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> Jesus answered, “How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? They cannot, so long as they have him with them.",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and on that day they will fast.",
			"21": "<sup>21</sup> “No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. Otherwise, the new piece will pull away from the old, making the tear worse.",
			"22": "<sup>22</sup> And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins.”",
			"23": "<sup>23</sup> Jesus Is Lord of the Sabbath\nOne Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and as his disciples walked along, they began to pick some heads of grain.",
			"24": "<sup>24</sup> The Pharisees said to him, “Look, why are they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?”",
			"25": "<sup>25</sup> He answered, “Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need?",
			"26": "<sup>26</sup> In the days of Abiathar the high priest, he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread, which is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions.”",
			"27": "<sup>27</sup> Then he said to them, “The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.",
			"28": "<sup>28</sup> So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.”"

			"1": "<sup>1</sup> Jesus Heals on the Sabbath\nAnother time Jesus went into the synagogue, and a man with a shriveled hand was there.",
			"2": "<sup>2</sup> Some of them were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath.",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> Jesus said to the man with the shriveled hand, “Stand up in front of everyone.”",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> Then Jesus asked them, “Which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?” But they remained silent.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> He looked around at them in anger and, deeply distressed at their stubborn hearts, said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out, and his hand was completely restored.",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> Crowds Follow Jesus\nJesus withdrew with his disciples to the lake, and a large crowd from Galilee followed.",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> When they heard about all he was doing, many people came to him from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, and the regions across the Jordan and around Tyre and Sidon.",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> Because of the crowd he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him, to keep the people from crowding him.",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> For he had healed many, so that those with diseases were pushing forward to touch him.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> Whenever the impure spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, “You are the Son of God.”",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> But he gave them strict orders not to tell others about him.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> Jesus Appoints the Twelve\nJesus went up on a mountainside and called to him those he wanted, and they came to him.",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> He appointed twelve that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> and to have authority to drive out demons.",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> These are the twelve he appointed: Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter),",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> James son of Zebedee and his brother John (to them he gave the name Boanerges, which means “sons of thunder”),",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> Jesus Accused by His Family and by Teachers of the Law\nThen Jesus entered a house, and again a crowd gathered, so that he and his disciples were not even able to eat.",
			"21": "<sup>21</sup> When his family heard about this, they went to take charge of him, for they said, “He is out of his mind.”",
			"22": "<sup>22</sup> And the teachers of the law who came down from Jerusalem said, “He is possessed by Beelzebul! By the prince of demons he is driving out demons.”",
			"23": "<sup>23</sup> So Jesus called them over to him and began to speak to them in parables: “How can Satan drive out Satan?",
			"24": "<sup>24</sup> If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.",
			"25": "<sup>25</sup> If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.",
			"26": "<sup>26</sup> And if Satan opposes himself and is divided, he cannot stand; his end has come.",
			"27": "<sup>27</sup> In fact, no one can enter a strong man’s house without first tying him up. Then he can plunder the strong man’s house.",
			"28": "<sup>28</sup> Truly I tell you, people can be forgiven all their sins and every slander they utter,",
			"29": "<sup>29</sup> but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; they are guilty of an eternal sin.”",
			"30": "<sup>30</sup> He said this because they were saying, “He has an impure spirit.”",
			"31": "<sup>31</sup> Then Jesus’ mother and brothers arrived. Standing outside, they sent someone in to call him.",
			"32": "<sup>32</sup> A crowd was sitting around him, and they told him, “Your mother and brothers are outside looking for you.”",
			"33": "<sup>33</sup> “Who are my mother and my brothers?” he asked.",
			"34": "<sup>34</sup> Then he looked at those seated in a circle around him and said, “Here are my mother and my brothers!",
			"35": "<sup>35</sup> Whoever does God’s will is my brother and sister and mother.”"

			"1": "<sup>1</sup> The Parable of the Sower\nAgain Jesus began to teach by the lake. The crowd that gathered around him was so large that he got into a boat and sat in it out on the lake, while all the people were along the shore at the water’s edge.",
			"2": "<sup>2</sup> He taught them many things by parables, and in his teaching said:",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> “Listen! A farmer went out to sow his seed.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow.",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants, so that they did not bear grain.",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up, grew and produced a crop, some multiplying thirty, some sixty, some a hundred times.”",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> Then Jesus said, “Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear.”",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> When he was alone, the Twelve and the others around him asked him about the parables.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> He told them, “The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those on the outside everything is said in parables",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> so that,\n“‘they may be ever seeing but never perceiving,\nand ever hearing but never understanding;\notherwise they might turn and be forgiven!’”",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> Then Jesus said to them, “Don’t you understand this parable? How then will you understand any parable?",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> The farmer sows the word.",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> Some people are like seed along the path, where the word is sown. As soon as they hear it, Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them.",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> Others, like seed sown on rocky places, hear the word and at once receive it with joy.",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> Still others, like seed sown among thorns, hear the word;",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word, making it unfruitful.",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> Others, like seed sown on good soil, hear the word, accept it, and produce a crop—some thirty, some sixty, some a hundred times what was sown.”",
			"21": "<sup>21</sup> A Lamp on a Stand\nHe said to them, “Do you bring in a lamp to put it under a bowl or a bed? Instead, don’t you put it on its stand?",
			"22": "<sup>22</sup> For whatever is hidden is meant to be disclosed, and whatever is concealed is meant to be brought out into the open.",
			"23": "<sup>23</sup> If anyone has ears to hear, let them hear.”",
			"24": "<sup>24</sup> “Consider carefully what you hear,” he continued. “With the measure you use, it will be measured to you—and even more.",
			"25": "<sup>25</sup> Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them.”",
			"26": "<sup>26</sup> The Parable of the Growing Seed\nHe also said, “This is what the kingdom of God is like. A man scatters seed on the ground.",
			"27": "<sup>27</sup> Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how.",
			"28": "<sup>28</sup> All by itself the soil produces grain—first the stalk, then the head, then the full kernel in the head.",
			"29": "<sup>29</sup> As soon as the grain is ripe, he puts the sickle to it, because the harvest has come.”",
			"30": "<sup>30</sup> The Parable of the Mustard Seed\nAgain he said, “What shall we say the kingdom of God is like, or what parable shall we use to describe it?",
			"31": "<sup>31</sup> It is like a mustard seed, which is the smallest of all seeds on earth.",
			"32": "<sup>32</sup> Yet when planted, it grows and becomes the largest of all garden plants, with such big branches that the birds can perch in its shade.”",
			"33": "<sup>33</sup> With many similar parables Jesus spoke the word to them, as much as they could understand.",
			"34": "<sup>34</sup> He did not say anything to them without using a parable. But when he was alone with his own disciples, he explained everything.",
			"35": "<sup>35</sup> Jesus Calms the Storm\nThat day when evening came, he said to his disciples, “Let us go over to the other side.”",
			"36": "<sup>36</sup> Leaving the crowd behind, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat. There were also other boats with him.",
			"37": "<sup>37</sup> A furious squall came up, and the waves broke over the boat, so that it was nearly swamped.",
			"38": "<sup>38</sup> Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. The disciples woke him and said to him, “Teacher, don’t you care if we drown?”",
			"39": "<sup>39</sup> He got up, rebuked the wind and said to the waves, “Quiet! Be still!” Then the wind died down and it was completely calm.",
			"40": "<sup>40</sup> He said to his disciples, “Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?”",
			"41": "<sup>41</sup> They were terrified and asked each other, “Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!”"

			"1": "<sup>1</sup> Jesus Restores a Demon-Possessed Man\nThey went across the lake to the region of the Gerasenes.",
			"2": "<sup>2</sup> When Jesus got out of the boat, a man with an impure spirit came from the tombs to meet him.",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> This man lived in the tombs, and no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> For he had often been chained hand and foot, but he tore the chains apart and broke the irons on his feet. No one was strong enough to subdue him.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> Night and day among the tombs and in the hills he would cry out and cut himself with stones.",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees in front of him.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> He shouted at the top of his voice, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? In God’s name don’t torture me!”",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> For Jesus had said to him, “Come out of this man, you impure spirit!”",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> Then Jesus asked him, “What is your name?”\n“My name is Legion,” he replied, “for we are many.”",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside.",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> The demons begged Jesus, “Send us among the pigs; allow us to go into them.”",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> He gave them permission, and the impure spirits came out and went into the pigs. The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened.",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons, sitting there, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> Those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man—and told about the pigs as well.",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> Then the people began to plead with Jesus to leave their region.",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with him.",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> Jesus did not let him, but said, “Go home to your own people and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you.”",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> So the man went away and began to tell in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him. And all the people were amazed.",
			"21": "<sup>21</sup> Jesus Raises a Dead Girl and Heals a Sick Woman\nWhen Jesus had again crossed over by boat to the other side of the lake, a large crowd gathered around him while he was by the lake.",
			"22": "<sup>22</sup> Then one of the synagogue leaders, named Jairus, came, and when he saw Jesus, he fell at his feet.",
			"23": "<sup>23</sup> He pleaded earnestly with him, “My little daughter is dying. Please come and put your hands on her so that she will be healed and live.”",
			"24": "<sup>24</sup> So Jesus went with him.\nA large crowd followed and pressed around him.",

			"26": "<sup>26</sup> She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better she grew worse.",
			"27": "<sup>27</sup> When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak,",
			"28": "<sup>28</sup> because she thought, “If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed.”",
			"29": "<sup>29</sup> Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering.",
			"30": "<sup>30</sup> At once Jesus realized that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and asked, “Who touched my clothes?”",
			"31": "<sup>31</sup> “You see the people crowding against you,” his disciples answered, “and yet you can ask, ‘Who touched me?’ ”",
			"32": "<sup>32</sup> But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it.",
			"33": "<sup>33</sup> Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet and, trembling with fear, told him the whole truth.",
			"34": "<sup>34</sup> He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering.”",
			"35": "<sup>35</sup> While Jesus was still speaking, some people came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue leader. “Your daughter is dead,” they said. “Why bother the teacher anymore?”",
			"36": "<sup>36</sup> Overhearing what they said, Jesus told him, “Don’t be afraid; just believe.”",
			"37": "<sup>37</sup> He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James and John the brother of James.",
			"38": "<sup>38</sup> When they came to the home of the synagogue leader, Jesus saw a commotion, with people crying and wailing loudly.",
			"39": "<sup>39</sup> He went in and said to them, “Why all this commotion and wailing? The child is not dead but asleep.”",
			"40": "<sup>40</sup> But they laughed at him.\nAfter he put them all out, he took the child’s father and mother and the disciples who were with him, and went in where the child was.",
			"41": "<sup>41</sup> He took her by the hand and said to her, “Talitha koum!” (which means “Little girl, I say to you, get up!”).",
			"42": "<sup>42</sup> Immediately the girl stood up and began to walk around (she was twelve years old). At this they were completely astonished.",
