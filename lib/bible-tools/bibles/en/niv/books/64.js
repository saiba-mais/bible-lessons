			"2": "<sup>2</sup> Dear friend, I pray that you may enjoy good health and that all may go well with you, even as your soul is getting along well.",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> It gave me great joy when some believers came and testified about your faithfulness to the truth, telling how you continue to walk in it.",

			"5": "<sup>5</sup> Dear friend, you are faithful in what you are doing for the brothers and sisters, even though they are strangers to you.",
