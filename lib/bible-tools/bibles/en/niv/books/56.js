			"15": "<sup>15</sup> To the pure, all things are pure, but to those who are corrupted and do not believe, nothing is pure. In fact, both their minds and consciences are corrupted.",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> They claim to know God, but by their actions they deny him. They are detestable, disobedient and unfit for doing anything good."

			"11": "<sup>11</sup> For the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people.",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> It teaches us to say “No” to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age,",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> while we wait for the blessed hope—the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ,",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very own, eager to do what is good.",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> These, then, are the things you should teach. Encourage and rebuke with all authority. Do not let anyone despise you."

			"4": "<sup>4</sup> But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared,",
