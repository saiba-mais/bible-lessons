			"2": "<sup>2</sup> but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom also he made the universe.",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> The Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word. After he had provided purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> So he became as much superior to the angels as the name he has inherited is superior to theirs.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> The Son Superior to Angels\nFor to which of the angels did God ever say,\n“You are my Son;\ntoday I have become your Father”?\nOr again,\n“I will be his Father,\nand he will be my Son”?",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> And again, when God brings his firstborn into the world, he says,\n“Let all God’s angels worship him.”",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> In speaking of the angels he says,\n“He makes his angels spirits,\nand his servants flames of fire.”",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> But about the Son he says,\n“Your throne, O God, will last for ever and ever;\na scepter of justice will be the scepter of your kingdom.",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness;\ntherefore God, your God, has set you above your companions\nby anointing you with the oil of joy.”",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> He also says,\n“In the beginning, Lord, you laid the foundations of the earth,\nand the heavens are the work of your hands.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> They will perish, but you remain;\nthey will all wear out like a garment.",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> You will roll them up like a robe;\nlike a garment they will be changed.\nBut you remain the same,\nand your years will never end.”",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> To which of the angels did God ever say,\n“Sit at my right hand\nuntil I make your enemies\na footstool for your feet”?",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> Are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?"

			"1": "<sup>1</sup> Warning to Pay Attention\nWe must pay the most careful attention, therefore, to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away.",
			"2": "<sup>2</sup> For since the message spoken through angels was binding, and every violation and disobedience received its just punishment,",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> how shall we escape if we ignore so great a salvation? This salvation, which was first announced by the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard him.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> God also testified to it by signs, wonders and various miracles, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> Jesus Made Fully Human\nIt is not to angels that he has subjected the world to come, about which we are speaking.",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> But there is a place where someone has testified:\n“What is mankind that you are mindful of them,\na son of man that you care for him?",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> You made them a little lower than the angels;\nyou crowned them with glory and honor",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and put everything under their feet.”\nIn putting everything under them, God left nothing that is not subject to them. Yet at present we do not see everything subject to them.",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> But we do see Jesus, who was made lower than the angels for a little while, now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> In bringing many sons and daughters to glory, it was fitting that God, for whom and through whom everything exists, should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through what he suffered.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> Both the one who makes people holy and those who are made holy are of the same family. So Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters.",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> He says,\n“I will declare your name to my brothers and sisters;\nin the assembly I will sing your praises.”",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> And again,\n“I will put my trust in him.”\nAnd again he says,\n“Here am I, and the children God has given me.”",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> Since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might break the power of him who holds the power of death—that is, the devil—",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death.",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> For surely it is not angels he helps, but Abraham’s descendants.",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> For this reason he had to be made like them, fully human in every way, in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, and that he might make atonement for the sins of the people.",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted."

			"1": "<sup>1</sup> Jesus Greater Than Moses\nTherefore, holy brothers and sisters, who share in the heavenly calling, fix your thoughts on Jesus, whom we acknowledge as our apostle and high priest.",
			"2": "<sup>2</sup> He was faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses was faithful in all God’s house.",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> Jesus has been found worthy of greater honor than Moses, just as the builder of a house has greater honor than the house itself.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> For every house is built by someone, but God is the builder of everything.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> “Moses was faithful as a servant in all God’s house,” bearing witness to what would be spoken by God in the future.",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> But Christ is faithful as the Son over God’s house. And we are his house, if indeed we hold firmly to our confidence and the hope in which we glory.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> Warning Against Unbelief\nSo, as the Holy Spirit says:\n“Today, if you hear his voice,",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do not harden your hearts\nas you did in the rebellion,\nduring the time of testing in the wilderness,",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> where your ancestors tested and tried me,\nthough for forty years they saw what I did.",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> That is why I was angry with that generation;\nI said, ‘Their hearts are always going astray,\nand they have not known my ways.’",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> So I declared on oath in my anger,\n‘They shall never enter my rest.’ ”",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> See to it, brothers and sisters, that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called “Today,” so that none of you may be hardened by sin’s deceitfulness.",

			"15": "<sup>15</sup> As has just been said:\n“Today, if you hear his voice,\ndo not harden your hearts\nas you did in the rebellion.”",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> Who were they who heard and rebelled? Were they not all those Moses led out of Egypt?",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> And with whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies perished in the wilderness?",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> And to whom did God swear that they would never enter his rest if not to those who disobeyed?",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> So we see that they were not able to enter, because of their unbelief."

			"2": "<sup>2</sup> For we also have had the good news proclaimed to us, just as they did; but the message they heard was of no value to them, because they did not share the faith of those who obeyed.",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> Now we who have believed enter that rest, just as God has said,\n“So I declared on oath in my anger,\n‘They shall never enter my rest.’”\nAnd yet his works have been finished since the creation of the world.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> For somewhere he has spoken about the seventh day in these words: “On the seventh day God rested from all his works.”",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> And again in the passage above he says, “They shall never enter my rest.”",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> Therefore since it still remains for some to enter that rest, and since those who formerly had the good news proclaimed to them did not go in because of their disobedience,",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> God again set a certain day, calling it “Today.” This he did when a long time later he spoke through David, as in the passage already quoted:\n“Today, if you hear his voice,\ndo not harden your hearts.”",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later about another day.",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> There remains, then, a Sabbath-rest for the people of God;",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> for anyone who enters God’s rest also rests from their works, just as God did from his.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will perish by following their example of disobedience.",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> Nothing in all creation is hidden from God’s sight. Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give account.",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> Jesus the Great High Priest\nTherefore, since we have a great high priest who has ascended into heaven, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess.",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> For we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet he did not sin.",

			"3": "<sup>3</sup> This is why he has to offer sacrifices for his own sins, as well as for the sins of the people.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> And no one takes this honor on himself, but he receives it when called by God, just as Aaron was.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> In the same way, Christ did not take on himself the glory of becoming a high priest. But God said to him,\n“You are my Son;\ntoday I have become your Father.”",

			"13": "<sup>13</sup> Anyone who lives on milk, being still an infant, is not acquainted with the teaching about righteousness.",

			"14": "<sup>14</sup> saying, “I will surely bless you and give you many descendants.”",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> And so after waiting patiently, Abraham received what was promised.",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> People swear by someone greater than themselves, and the oath confirms what is said and puts an end to all argument.",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> Because God wanted to make the unchanging nature of his purpose very clear to the heirs of what was promised, he confirmed it with an oath.",

			"19": "<sup>19</sup> We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure. It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain,",

			"2": "<sup>2</sup> and Abraham gave him a tenth of everything. First, the name Melchizedek means “king of righteousness”; then also, “king of Salem” means “king of peace.”",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> Without father or mother, without genealogy, without beginning of days or end of life, resembling the Son of God, he remains a priest forever.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> Just think how great he was: Even the patriarch Abraham gave him a tenth of the plunder!",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> Now the law requires the descendants of Levi who become priests to collect a tenth from the people—that is, from their fellow Israelites—even though they also are descended from Abraham.",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> This man, however, did not trace his descent from Levi, yet he collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> And without doubt the lesser is blessed by the greater.",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> In the one case, the tenth is collected by people who die; but in the other case, by him who is declared to be living.",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> One might even say that Levi, who collects the tenth, paid the tenth through Abraham,",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> because when Melchizedek met Abraham, Levi was still in the body of his ancestor.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> Jesus Like Melchizedek\nIf perfection could have been attained through the Levitical priesthood—and indeed the law given to the people established that priesthood—why was there still need for another priest to come, one in the order of Melchizedek, not in the order of Aaron?",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> For when the priesthood is changed, the law must be changed also.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> He of whom these things are said belonged to a different tribe, and no one from that tribe has ever served at the altar.",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> For it is clear that our Lord descended from Judah, and in regard to that tribe Moses said nothing about priests.",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> And what we have said is even more clear if another priest like Melchizedek appears,",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> one who has become a priest not on the basis of a regulation as to his ancestry but on the basis of the power of an indestructible life.",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> For it is declared:\n“You are a priest forever,\nin the order of Melchizedek.”",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> The former regulation is set aside because it was weak and useless",

			"20": "<sup>20</sup> And it was not without an oath! Others became priests without any oath,",
			"21": "<sup>21</sup> but he became a priest with an oath when God said to him:\n“The Lord has sworn\nand will not change his mind:\n‘You are a priest forever.’”",
			"22": "<sup>22</sup> Because of this oath, Jesus has become the guarantor of a better covenant.",
			"23": "<sup>23</sup> Now there have been many of those priests, since death prevented them from continuing in office;",
			"24": "<sup>24</sup> but because Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood.",
			"25": "<sup>25</sup> Therefore he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them.",
			"26": "<sup>26</sup> Such a high priest truly meets our need—one who is holy, blameless, pure, set apart from sinners, exalted above the heavens.",
			"27": "<sup>27</sup> Unlike the other high priests, he does not need to offer sacrifices day after day, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. He sacrificed for their sins once for all when he offered himself.",
			"28": "<sup>28</sup> For the law appoints as high priests men in all their weakness; but the oath, which came after the law, appointed the Son, who has been made perfect forever."

			"1": "<sup>1</sup> The High Priest of a New Covenant\nNow the main point of what we are saying is this: We do have such a high priest, who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven,",
			"2": "<sup>2</sup> and who serves in the sanctuary, the true tabernacle set up by the Lord, not by a mere human being.",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> Every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices, and so it was necessary for this one also to have something to offer.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> If he were on earth, he would not be a priest, for there are already priests who offer the gifts prescribed by the law.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> They serve at a sanctuary that is a copy and shadow of what is in heaven. This is why Moses was warned when he was about to build the tabernacle: “See to it that you make everything according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.”",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> But in fact the ministry Jesus has received is as superior to theirs as the covenant of which he is mediator is superior to the old one, since the new covenant is established on better promises.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> For if there had been nothing wrong with that first covenant, no place would have been sought for another.",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> But God found fault with the people and said:\n“The days are coming, declares the Lord,\nwhen I will make a new covenant\nwith the people of Israel\nand with the people of Judah.",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> It will not be like the covenant\nI made with their ancestors\nwhen I took them by the hand\nto lead them out of Egypt,\nbecause they did not remain faithful to my covenant,\nand I turned away from them,\ndeclares the Lord.",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> This is the covenant I will establish with the people of Israel\nafter that time, declares the Lord.\nI will put my laws in their minds\nand write them on their hearts.\nI will be their God,\nand they will be my people.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> No longer will they teach their neighbor,\nor say to one another, ‘Know the Lord,’\nbecause they will all know me,\nfrom the least of them to the greatest.",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> For I will forgive their wickedness\nand will remember their sins no more.”",

			"3": "<sup>3</sup> Behind the second curtain was a room called the Most Holy Place,",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> which had the golden altar of incense and the gold-covered ark of the covenant. This ark contained the gold jar of manna, Aaron’s staff that had budded, and the stone tablets of the covenant.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> Above the ark were the cherubim of the Glory, overshadowing the atonement cover. But we cannot discuss these things in detail now.",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> When everything had been arranged like this, the priests entered regularly into the outer room to carry on their ministry.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> But only the high priest entered the inner room, and that only once a year, and never without blood, which he offered for himself and for the sins the people had committed in ignorance.",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> The Holy Spirit was showing by this that the way into the Most Holy Place had not yet been disclosed as long as the first tabernacle was still functioning.",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> This is an illustration for the present time, indicating that the gifts and sacrifices being offered were not able to clear the conscience of the worshiper.",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> They are only a matter of food and drink and various ceremonial washings—external regulations applying until the time of the new order.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> The Blood of Christ\nBut when Christ came as high priest of the good things that are now already here, he went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that is not made with human hands, that is to say, is not a part of this creation.",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves; but he entered the Most Holy Place once for all by his own blood, thus obtaining eternal redemption.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> The blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are ceremonially unclean sanctify them so that they are outwardly clean.",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> How much more, then, will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from acts that lead to death, so that we may serve the living God!",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> For this reason Christ is the mediator of a new covenant, that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance—now that he has died as a ransom to set them free from the sins committed under the first covenant.",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> In the case of a will, it is necessary to prove the death of the one who made it,",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> because a will is in force only when somebody has died; it never takes effect while the one who made it is living.",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> This is why even the first covenant was not put into effect without blood.",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> When Moses had proclaimed every command of the law to all the people, he took the blood of calves, together with water, scarlet wool and branches of hyssop, and sprinkled the scroll and all the people.",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> He said, “This is the blood of the covenant, which God has commanded you to keep.”",
			"21": "<sup>21</sup> In the same way, he sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle and everything used in its ceremonies.",
			"22": "<sup>22</sup> In fact, the law requires that nearly everything be cleansed with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.",
			"23": "<sup>23</sup> It was necessary, then, for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.",
			"24": "<sup>24</sup> For Christ did not enter a sanctuary made with human hands that was only a copy of the true one; he entered heaven itself, now to appear for us in God’s presence.",
			"25": "<sup>25</sup> Nor did he enter heaven to offer himself again and again, the way the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every year with blood that is not his own.",
			"26": "<sup>26</sup> Otherwise Christ would have had to suffer many times since the creation of the world. But he has appeared once for all at the culmination of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself.",
			"27": "<sup>27</sup> Just as people are destined to die once, and after that to face judgment,",
			"28": "<sup>28</sup> so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many; and he will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him."

			"1": "<sup>1</sup> Christ’s Sacrifice Once for All\nThe law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming—not the realities themselves. For this reason it can never, by the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year, make perfect those who draw near to worship.",
			"2": "<sup>2</sup> Otherwise, would they not have stopped being offered? For the worshipers would have been cleansed once for all, and would no longer have felt guilty for their sins.",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> But those sacrifices are an annual reminder of sins.",

			"23": "<sup>23</sup> Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful.",
			"24": "<sup>24</sup> And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds,",

			"26": "<sup>26</sup> If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left,",
