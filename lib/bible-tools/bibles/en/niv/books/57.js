			"1": "<sup>1</sup> Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother,\nTo Philemon our dear friend and fellow worker—",
			"2": "<sup>2</sup> also to Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier—and to the church that meets in your home:",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> Thanksgiving and Prayer\nI always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers,",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> because I hear about your love for all his holy people and your faith in the Lord Jesus.",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> I pray that your partnership with us in the faith may be effective in deepening your understanding of every good thing we share for the sake of Christ.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> Your love has given me great joy and encouragement, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the Lord’s people.",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> Paul’s Plea for Onesimus\nTherefore, although in Christ I could be bold and order you to do what you ought to do,",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> yet I prefer to appeal to you on the basis of love. It is as none other than Paul—an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus—",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> that I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, who became my son while I was in chains.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> Formerly he was useless to you, but now he has become useful both to you and to me.",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> I am sending him—who is my very heart—back to you.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> I would have liked to keep him with me so that he could take your place in helping me while I am in chains for the gospel.",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that any favor you do would not seem forced but would be voluntary.",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you might have him back forever—",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear brother. He is very dear to me but even dearer to you, both as a fellow man and as a brother in the Lord.",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me.",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> If he has done you any wrong or owes you anything, charge it to me.",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand. I will pay it back—not to mention that you owe me your very self.",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> I do wish, brother, that I may have some benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.",
			"21": "<sup>21</sup> Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask.",
			"22": "<sup>22</sup> And one thing more: Prepare a guest room for me, because I hope to be restored to you in answer to your prayers.",
			"23": "<sup>23</sup> Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings.",
			"24": "<sup>24</sup> And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my fellow workers.",
			"25": "<sup>25</sup> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit."
