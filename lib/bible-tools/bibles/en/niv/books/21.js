			"5": "<sup>5</sup> The sun rises and the sun sets,\nand hurries back to where it rises.",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> The wind blows to the south\nand turns to the north;\nround and round it goes,\never returning on its course.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> All streams flow into the sea,\nyet the sea is never full.\nTo the place the streams come from,\nthere they return again.",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> All things are wearisome,\nmore than one can say.\nThe eye never has enough of seeing,\nnor the ear its fill of hearing.",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> What has been will be again,\nwhat has been done will be done again;\nthere is nothing new under the sun.",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> Is there anything of which one can say,\n“Look! This is something new”?\nIt was here already, long ago;\nit was here before our time.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> No one remembers the former generations,\nand even those yet to come\nwill not be remembered\nby those who follow them.",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> Wisdom Is Meaningless\nI, the Teacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> I applied my mind to study and to explore by wisdom all that is done under the heavens. What a heavy burden God has laid on mankind!",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind.",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> What is crooked cannot be straightened;\nwhat is lacking cannot be counted.",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> I said to myself, “Look, I have increased in wisdom more than anyone who has ruled over Jerusalem before me; I have experienced much of wisdom and knowledge.”",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> Then I applied myself to the understanding of wisdom, and also of madness and folly, but I learned that this, too, is a chasing after the wind.",

			"2": "<sup>2</sup> “Laughter,” I said, “is madness. And what does pleasure accomplish?”",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> I tried cheering myself with wine, and embracing folly—my mind still guiding me with wisdom. I wanted to see what was good for people to do under the heavens during the few days of their lives.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> I undertook great projects: I built houses for myself and planted vineyards.",

			"7": "<sup>7</sup> I bought male and female slaves and had other slaves who were born in my house. I also owned more herds and flocks than anyone in Jerusalem before me.",

			"10": "<sup>10</sup> I denied myself nothing my eyes desired;\nI refused my heart no pleasure.\nMy heart took delight in all my labor,\nand this was the reward for all my toil.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> Yet when I surveyed all that my hands had done\nand what I had toiled to achieve,\neverything was meaningless, a chasing after the wind;\nnothing was gained under the sun.",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> Wisdom and Folly Are Meaningless\nThen I turned my thoughts to consider wisdom,\nand also madness and folly.\nWhat more can the king’s successor do\nthan what has already been done?",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> I saw that wisdom is better than folly,\njust as light is better than darkness.",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> The wise have eyes in their heads,\nwhile the fool walks in the darkness;\nbut I came to realize\nthat the same fate overtakes them both.",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> Then I said to myself,\n“The fate of the fool will overtake me also.\nWhat then do I gain by being wise?”\nI said to myself,\n“This too is meaningless.”",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> For the wise, like the fool, will not be long remembered;\nthe days have already come when both have been forgotten.\nLike the fool, the wise too must die!",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> Toil Is Meaningless\nSo I hated life, because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me. All of it is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> I hated all the things I had toiled for under the sun, because I must leave them to the one who comes after me.",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> And who knows whether that person will be wise or foolish? Yet they will have control over all the fruit of my toil into which I have poured my effort and skill under the sun. This too is meaningless.",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> So my heart began to despair over all my toilsome labor under the sun.",
			"21": "<sup>21</sup> For a person may labor with wisdom, knowledge and skill, and then they must leave all they own to another who has not toiled for it. This too is meaningless and a great misfortune.",
			"22": "<sup>22</sup> What do people get for all the toil and anxious striving with which they labor under the sun?",
			"23": "<sup>23</sup> All their days their work is grief and pain; even at night their minds do not rest. This too is meaningless.",
			"24": "<sup>24</sup> A person can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in their own toil. This too, I see, is from the hand of God,",
			"25": "<sup>25</sup> for without him, who can eat or find enjoyment?",
			"26": "<sup>26</sup> To the person who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge and happiness, but to the sinner he gives the task of gathering and storing up wealth to hand it over to the one who pleases God. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind."

			"11": "<sup>11</sup> He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the human heart; yet no one can fathom what God has done from beginning to end.",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> I know that there is nothing better for people than to be happy and to do good while they live.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> That each of them may eat and drink, and find satisfaction in all their toil—this is the gift of God.",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> I know that everything God does will endure forever; nothing can be added to it and nothing taken from it. God does it so that people will fear him.",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> Whatever is has already been,\nand what will be has been before;\nand God will call the past to account.",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> And I saw something else under the sun:\nIn the place of judgment—wickedness was there,\nin the place of justice—wickedness was there.",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> I said to myself,\n“God will bring into judgment\nboth the righteous and the wicked,\nfor there will be a time for every activity,\na time to judge every deed.”",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> I also said to myself, “As for humans, God tests them so that they may see that they are like the animals.",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> Surely the fate of human beings is like that of the animals; the same fate awaits them both: As one dies, so dies the other. All have the same breath; humans have no advantage over animals. Everything is meaningless.",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> All go to the same place; all come from dust, and to dust all return.",
			"21": "<sup>21</sup> Who knows if the human spirit rises upward and if the spirit of the animal goes down into the earth?”",
			"22": "<sup>22</sup> So I saw that there is nothing better for a person than to enjoy their work, because that is their lot. For who can bring them to see what will happen after them?"

			"6": "<sup>6</sup> Better one handful with tranquillity\nthan two handfuls with toil\nand chasing after the wind.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> Again I saw something meaningless under the sun:",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> There was a man all alone;\nhe had neither son nor brother.\nThere was no end to his toil,\nyet his eyes were not content with his wealth.\n“For whom am I toiling,” he asked,\n“and why am I depriving myself of enjoyment?”\nThis too is meaningless—\na miserable business!",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> Two are better than one,\nbecause they have a good return for their labor:",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> If either of them falls down,\none can help the other up.\nBut pity anyone who falls\nand has no one to help them up.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> Also, if two lie down together, they will keep warm.\nBut how can one keep warm alone?",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> Though one may be overpowered,\ntwo can defend themselves.\nA cord of three strands is not quickly broken.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> Advancement Is Meaningless\nBetter a poor but wise youth than an old but foolish king who no longer knows how to heed a warning.",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> The youth may have come from prison to the kingship, or he may have been born in poverty within his kingdom.",

			"4": "<sup>4</sup> When you make a vow to God, do not delay to fulfill it. He has no pleasure in fools; fulfill your vow.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> It is better not to make a vow than to make one and not fulfill it.",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> Do not let your mouth lead you into sin. And do not protest to the temple messenger, “My vow was a mistake.” Why should God be angry at what you say and destroy the work of your hands?",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> Much dreaming and many words are meaningless. Therefore fear God.",
