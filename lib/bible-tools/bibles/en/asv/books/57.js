			"4": "<sup>4</sup> I thank my God always, making mention of thee in my prayers,",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> hearing of thy love, and of the faith which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints;",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> that the fellowship of thy faith may become effectual, in the knowledge of every good thing which is in you, unto Christ.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> For I had much joy and comfort in thy love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through thee, brother.",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> Wherefore, though I have all boldness in Christ to enjoin thee that which is befitting,",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> yet for loveâ€™s sake I rather beseech, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now a prisoner also of Christ Jesus:",

			"11": "<sup>11</sup> who once was unprofitable to thee, but now is profitable to thee and to me:",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> whom I have sent back to thee in his own person, that is, my very heart:",

			"14": "<sup>14</sup> but without thy mind I would do nothing; that thy goodness should not be as of necessity, but of free will.",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> For perhaps he was therefore parted from thee for a season, that thou shouldest have him for ever;",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> no longer as a servant, but more than a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much rather to thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord.",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> If then thou countest me a partner, receive him as myself.",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> But if he hath wronged thee at all, or oweth thee aught, put that to mine account;",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> I Paul write it with mine own hand, I will repay it: that I say not unto thee that thou owest to me even thine own self besides.",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my heart in Christ.",
			"21": "<sup>21</sup> Having confidence in thine obedience I write unto thee, knowing that thou wilt do even beyond what I say.",
			"22": "<sup>22</sup> But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I hope that through your prayers I shall be granted unto you.",
			"23": "<sup>23</sup> Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus, saluteth thee;",
			"24": "<sup>24</sup> and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow-workers.",
			"25": "<sup>25</sup> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen."
