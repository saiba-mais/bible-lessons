			"7": "<sup>7</sup> ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> And even as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also withstand the truth; men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith.",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be evident unto all men, as theirs also came to be.",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> But thou didst follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, patience,",
