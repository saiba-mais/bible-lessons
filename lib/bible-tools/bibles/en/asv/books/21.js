			"4": "<sup>4</sup> One generation goeth, and another generation cometh; but the earth abideth for ever.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to its place where it ariseth.",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it turneth about continually in its course, and the wind returneth again to its circuits.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full; unto the place whither the rivers go, thither they go again.",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> All things are full of weariness; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> That which hath been is that which shall be; and that which hath been done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> Is there a thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been long ago, in the ages which were before us.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> There is no remembrance of the former generations; neither shall there be any remembrance of the latter generations that are to come, among those that shall come after.",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> And I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under heaven: it is a sore travail that God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith.",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and a striving after wind.",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> That which is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I have gotten me great wisdom above all that were before me in Jerusalem; yea, my heart hath had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> And I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also was a striving after wind.",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> For in much wisdom is much grief; and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow."

			"2": "<sup>2</sup> I said of laughter, It is mad; and of mirth, What doeth it?",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> I searched in my heart how to cheer my flesh with wine, my heart yet guiding me with wisdom, and how to lay hold on folly, till I might see what it was good for the sons of men that they should do under heaven all the days of their life.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards;",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> I made me gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit;",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> I made me pools of water, to water therefrom the forest where trees were reared;",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> I bought men-servants and maid-servants, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of herds and flocks, above all that were before me in Jerusalem;",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> I gathered me also silver and gold, and the treasure of kings and of the provinces; I gat me men-singers and women-singers, and the delights of the sons of men, musical instruments, and that of all sorts.",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them; I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced because of all my labor; and this was my portion from all my labor.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labor that I had labored to do; and, behold, all was vanity and a striving after wind, and there was no profit under the sun.",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what can the man do that cometh after the king? even  that which hath been done long ago.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> The wise man’s eyes are in his head, and the fool walketh in darkness: and yet I perceived that one event happeneth to them all.",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so will it happen even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then said I in my heart, that this also is vanity.",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no remembrance for ever; seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. And how doth the wise man die even as the fool!",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> So I hated life, because the work that is wrought under the sun was grievous unto me; for all is vanity and a striving after wind.",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> And I hated all my labor wherein I labored under the sun, seeing that I must leave it unto the man that shall be after me.",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> And who knoweth whether he will be a wise man or a fool? yet will he have rule over all my labor wherein I have labored, and wherein I have showed myself wise under the sun. This also is vanity.",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> Therefore I turned about to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labor wherein I had labored under the sun.",
			"21": "<sup>21</sup> For there is a man whose labor is with wisdom, and with knowledge, and with skilfulness; yet to a man that hath not labored therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.",
			"22": "<sup>22</sup> For what hath a man of all his labor, and of the striving of his heart, wherein he laboreth under the sun?",
			"23": "<sup>23</sup> For all his days are but sorrows, and his travail is grief; yea, even in the night his heart taketh no rest. This also is vanity.",
			"24": "<sup>24</sup> There is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and make his soul enjoy good in his labor. This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God.",
			"25": "<sup>25</sup> For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, more than I?",
			"26": "<sup>26</sup> For to the man that pleaseth him God giveth wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that pleaseth God. This also is vanity and a striving after wind."

			"18": "<sup>18</sup> I said in my heart, It is because of the sons of men, that God may prove them, and that they may see that they themselves are but as  beasts.",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; and man hath no preeminence above the beasts: for all is vanity.",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.",
			"21": "<sup>21</sup> Who knoweth the spirit of man, whether it goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast, whether it goeth downward to the earth?",

			"4": "<sup>4</sup> Then I saw all labor and every skilful work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbor. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.",

For whom then, saith he, do I labor, and deprive my soul of good? This also is vanity, yea, it is a sore travail.",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor.",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him that is alone when he falleth, and hath not another to lift him up.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth; but how can one be warm alone?",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> And if a man prevail against him that is alone, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.",
