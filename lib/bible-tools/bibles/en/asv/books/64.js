			"1": "<sup>1</sup> The elder unto Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth.",
			"2": "<sup>2</sup> Beloved, I pray that in all things thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> For I rejoiced greatly, when brethren came and bare witness unto thy truth, even as thou walkest in truth.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> Greater joy have I none than this, to hear of my children walking in the truth.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> Beloved, thou doest a faithful work in whatsoever thou doest toward them that are brethren and strangers withal;",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> who bare witness to thy love before the church: whom thou wilt do well to set forward on their journey worthily of God:",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> because that for the sake of the Name they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> We therefore ought to welcome such, that we may be fellow-workers for the truth.",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> I wrote somewhat unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> Therefore, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his works which he doeth, prating against us with wicked words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and them that would he forbiddeth and casteth them out of the church.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> Beloved, imitate not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: he that doeth evil hath not seen God.",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> Demetrius hath the witness of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, we also bear witness; and thou knowest that our witness is true.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> I had many things to write unto thee, but I am unwilling to write them to thee with ink and pen:",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> but I hope shortly to see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be unto thee. The friends salute thee. Salute the friends by name."
