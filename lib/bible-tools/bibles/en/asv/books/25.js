			"3": "<sup>3</sup> Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude;\nShe dwelleth among the nations, she findeth no rest:\nAll her persecutors overtook her within the straits.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn assembly;\nAll her gates are desolate, her priests do sigh:\nHer virgins are afflicted, and she herself is in bitterness.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> Her adversaries are become the head, her enemies prosper;\nFor Jehovah hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions:\nHer young children are gone into captivity before the adversary.",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> And from the daughter of Zion all her majesty is departed:\nHer princes are become like harts that find no pasture,\nAnd they are gone without strength before the pursuer.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> Jerusalem remembereth in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that were from the days of old:\nWhen her people fell into the hand of the adversary, and none did help her,\nThe adversaries saw her, they did mock at her desolations.",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is become as an unclean thing;\nAll that honored her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness:\nYea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> Her filthiness was in her skirts; she remembered not her latter end;\nTherefore is she come down wonderfully; she hath no comforter:\nBehold, O Jehovah, my affliction; for the enemy hath magnified himself.",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things:\nFor she hath seen that the nations are entered into her sanctuary,\nConcerning whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thine assembly.",

			"12": "<sup>12</sup> Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by?\nBehold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is brought upon me,\nWherewith Jehovah hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> From on high hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them;\nHe hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back:\nHe hath made me desolate and faint all the day.",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand;\nThey are knit together, they are come up upon my neck; he hath made my strength to fail:\nThe Lord hath delivered me into their hands, against whom I am not able to stand.",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> The Lord hath set at nought all my mighty men in the midst of me;\nHe hath called a solemn assembly against me to crush my young men:\nThe Lord hath trodden as in a winepress the virgin daughter of Judah.",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water;\nBecause the comforter that should refresh my soul is far from me:\nMy children are desolate, because the enemy hath prevailed.",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> Zion spreadeth forth her hands; there is none to comfort her;\nJehovah hath commanded concerning Jacob, that they that are round about him should be his adversaries:\nJerusalem is among them as an unclean thing.",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> Jehovah is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment:\nHear, I pray you, all ye peoples, and behold my sorrow:\nMy virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> I called for my lovers, but they deceived me:\nMy priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city,\nWhile they sought them food to refresh their souls.",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> Behold, O Jehovah; for I am in distress; my heart is troubled;\nMy heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled:\nAbroad the sword bereaveth, at home there is as death.",
			"21": "<sup>21</sup> They have heard that I sigh; there is none to comfort me;\nAll mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done it:\nThou wilt bring the day that thou hast proclaimed, and they shall be like unto me.",
			"22": "<sup>22</sup> Let all their wickedness come before thee;\nAnd do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions:\nFor my sighs are many, and my heart is faint."

			"12": "<sup>12</sup> They say to their mothers, Where is grain and wine?\nWhen they swoon as the wounded in the streets of the city,\nWhen their soul is poured out into their mothersâ€™ bosom.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> What shall I testify unto thee? what shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem?\nWhat shall I compare to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion?\nFor thy breach is great like the sea: who can heal thee?",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> Thy prophets have seen for thee false and foolish visions;\nAnd they have not uncovered thine iniquity, to bring back thy captivity,\nBut have seen for thee false oracles and causes of banishment.",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> All that pass by clap their hands at thee;\nThey hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying,\nIs this the city that men called The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> All thine enemies have opened their mouth wide against thee;\nThey hiss and gnash the teeth; they say, We have swallowed her up;\nCertainly this is the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen it.",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> Jehovah hath done that which he purposed; he hath fulfilled his word that he commanded in the days of old;\nHe hath thrown down, and hath not pitied:\nAnd he hath caused the enemy to rejoice over thee; he hath exalted the horn of thine adversaries.",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> Their heart cried unto the Lord:\nO wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night;\nGive thyself no respite; let not the apple of thine eye cease.",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> Arise, cry out in the night, at the beginning of the watches;\nPour out thy heart like water before the face of the Lord:\nLift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger at the head of every street.",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> See, O Jehovah, and behold to whom thou hast done thus!\nShall the women eat their fruit, the children that are dandled in the hands?\nShall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?",
			"21": "<sup>21</sup> The youth and the old man lie on the ground in the streets;\nMy virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword:\nThou hast slain them in the day of thine anger; thou hast slaughtered, and not pitied.",
			"22": "<sup>22</sup> Thou hast called, as in the day of a solemn assembly, my terrors on every side;\nAnd there was none that escaped or remained in the day of Jehovahâ€™s anger:\nThose that I have dandled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed."
