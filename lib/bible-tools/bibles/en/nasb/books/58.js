			"3": "<sup>3</sup> And He is the radiance of His glory and the exact representation of His nature, and upholds all things by the word of His power. When He had made purification of sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> having become as much better than the angels, as He has inherited a more excellent name than they.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> For to which of the angels did He ever say, \"you are  my  son, today I have begotten  you\"? And again, \"I will be a  father to  Him  and  he shall be a  son to  me\"?",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> And when He again brings the firstborn into the world, He says, \"and let all the angels of  God worship  Him.\"",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> And of the angels He says, \"who makes  his angels winds, and  his ministers a flame of fire.\"",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> But of the Son He says, \"your  throne, o  God, is forever and ever, and the righteous scepter is the scepter of  his kingdom.",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> \"you have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; therefore  God, your  God, has  anointed  you with the oil of gladness above  your companions.\"",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> And, \"you, Lord, in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the works of  your hands;",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> they will perish, but  you remain; and they all will become old like a garment,",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> and like a mantle  you will roll them up; like a garment they will also be changed. but  you are  the same, and  your years will not come to an end.\"",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> But to which of the angels has He ever said, \"sit at  my right hand, until I make  your enemies A footstool for  your feet\"?",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> Are they not all ministering spirits, sent out to render service for the sake of those who will inherit salvation?"

			"1": "<sup>1</sup> For this reason we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away from it.",
			"2": "<sup>2</sup> For if the word spoken through angels proved unalterable, and every transgression and disobedience received a just penalty,",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> how will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation? After it was at the first spoken through the Lord, it was confirmed to us by those who heard,",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> God also testifying with them, both by signs and wonders and by various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit according to His own will.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> For He did not subject to angels the world to come, concerning which we are speaking.",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> But one has testified somewhere, saying, \"what is man, that  you remember him? or the son of man, that  you are concerned about him?",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> \"you have made him  for a little while lower than the angels; you have crowned him with glory and honor, and have appointed him over the  works of  your hands;",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> you have put all things in subjection under his feet.\" For in subjecting all things to him, He left nothing that is not subject to him. But now we do not yet see all things subjected to him.",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> But we do see Him who was made for a little while lower than the angels, namely, Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, so that by the grace of God He might taste death for everyone.",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to perfect the author of their salvation through sufferings.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> For both He who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one Father; for which reason He is not ashamed to call them brethren,",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> saying, \"I will proclaim  your name to  my brethren, in the midst of the  congregation  i will sing  your praise.\"",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> And again, \"I will put  my trust in  Him.\" And again, \"behold, I and the children whom  God has given  me.\"",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood, He Himself likewise also partook of the same, that through death He might render powerless him who had the power of death, that is, the devil,",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> and might free those who through fear of death were subject to slavery all their lives.",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> For assuredly He does not give help to angels, but He gives help to the descendant of Abraham.",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> Therefore, He had to be made like His brethren in all things, so that He might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> For since He Himself was tempted in that which He has suffered, He is able to come to the aid of those who are tempted."

			"3": "<sup>3</sup> For He has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by just so much as the builder of the house has more honor than the house.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> Now Moses was faithful in all His house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken later;",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> but Christ was faithful as a Son over His house-whose house we are, if we hold fast our confidence and the boast of our hope firm until the end.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> Therefore, just as the Holy Spirit says, \"today if you hear  his voice,",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> do not harden your hearts as  when  they provoked  me, as in the day of trial in the wilderness,",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> where your fathers tried  Me  by  testing  Me, and saw  my works for  forty years.",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> \"therefore I was angry with this  generation, and said, 'they always go astray in their  heart, and they did not know  my ways';",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> as I swore in  my wrath, 'they shall not enter  my rest.'\"",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> Take care, brethren, that there not be in any one of you an evil, unbelieving heart that falls away from the living God.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> But encourage one another day after day, as long as it is still called \"Today,\" so that none of you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our assurance firm until the end,",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> while it is said, \"today if you hear  his voice, do not harden your hearts, as  when they  provoked  me.\"",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> For who provoked Him when they had heard? Indeed, did not all those who came out of Egypt led by Moses?",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> And with whom was He angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> And to whom did He swear that they would not enter His rest, but to those who were disobedient?",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> So we see that they were not able to enter because of unbelief."
		},
		"4": {
			"1": "<sup>1</sup> Therefore, let us fear if, while a promise remains of entering His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short of it.",
			"2": "<sup>2</sup> For indeed we have had good news preached to us, just as they also; but the word they heard did not profit them, because it was not united by faith in those who heard.",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> For we who have believed enter that rest, just as He has said, \"as I swore in  my wrath, they shall not enter  my rest,\" although His works were finished from the foundation of the world.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> For He has said somewhere concerning the seventh day: \"and  God  rested on the  seventh day from all  his works\";",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> and again in this passage, \"they  shall not enter  my rest.\"",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> Therefore, since it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly had good news preached to them failed to enter because of disobedience,",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> He again fixes a certain day, \"Today,\" saying through David after so long a time just as has been said before, \"today if you hear  his voice, do not harden your hearts.\"",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> For if Joshua had given them rest, He would not have spoken of another day after that.",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> So there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God.",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> For the one who has entered His rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did from His.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> Therefore let us be diligent to enter that rest, so that no one will fall, through following the same example of disobedience.",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin.",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> Therefore let us draw near with confidence to the throne of grace, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need."

			"3": "<sup>3</sup> and because of it he is obligated to offer sacrifices for sins, as for the people, so also for himself.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> And no one takes the honor to himself, but receives it when he is called by God, even as Aaron was.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> So also Christ did not glorify Himself so as to become a high priest, but He who said to Him, \"you are  my  son, today I have begotten  you\";",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> just as He says also in another passage, \"you are a priest forever according to  the order of  melchizedek.\"",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> In the days of His flesh, He offered up both prayers and supplications with loud crying and tears to the One able to save Him from death, and He was heard because of His piety.",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> Although He was a Son, He learned obedience from the things which He suffered.",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> And having been made perfect, He became to all those who obey Him the source of eternal salvation,",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> being designated by God as a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> Concerning him we have much to say, and it is hard to explain, since you have become dull of hearing.",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you have need again for someone to teach you the elementary principles of the oracles of God, and you have come to need milk and not solid food.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> For everyone who partakes only of milk is not accustomed to the word of righteousness, for he is an infant.",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> But solid food is for the mature, who because of practice have their senses trained to discern good and evil."
		},
		"6": {

			"3": "<sup>3</sup> And this we will do, if God permits.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> For in the case of those who have once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit,",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come,",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> and then have fallen away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance, since they again crucify to themselves the Son of God and put Him to open shame.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> For ground that drinks the rain which often falls on it and brings forth vegetation useful to those for whose sake it is also tilled, receives a blessing from God;",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> but if it yields thorns and thistles, it is worthless and close to being cursed, and it ends up being burned.",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> But, beloved, we are convinced of better things concerning you, and things that accompany salvation, though we are speaking in this way.",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> For God is not unjust so as to forget your work and the love which you have shown toward His name, in having ministered and in still ministering to the saints.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> And we desire that each one of you show the same diligence so as to realize the full assurance of hope until the end,",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> so that you will not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> For when God made the promise to Abraham, since He could swear by no one greater, He swore by Himself,",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> saying, \"I will surely bless you and I will  surely multiply you.\"",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> And so, having patiently waited, he obtained the promise.",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> For men swear by one greater than themselves, and with them an oath given as confirmation is an end of every dispute.",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> In the same way God, desiring even more to show to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of His purpose, interposed with an oath,",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> so that by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have taken refuge would have strong encouragement to take hold of the hope set before us.",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, a hope both sure and steadfast and one which enters within the veil,",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> where Jesus has entered as a forerunner for us, having become a high priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek."

		"7": {
			"1": "<sup>1</sup> For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham as he was returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,",
			"2": "<sup>2</sup> to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth part of all the spoils, was first of all, by the translation of his name, king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace.",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, he remains a priest perpetually.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> Now observe how great this man was to whom Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth of the choicest spoils.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> And those indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest's office have commandment in the Law to collect a tenth from the people, that is, from their brethren, although these are descended from Abraham.",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> But the one whose genealogy is not traced from them collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed the one who had the promises.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater.",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> In this case mortal men receive tithes, but in that case one receives them, of whom it is witnessed that he lives on.",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> And, so to speak, through Abraham even Levi, who received tithes, paid tithes,",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> Now if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood (for on the basis of it the people received the Law), what further need was there for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek, and not be designated according to the order of Aaron?",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> For when the priesthood is changed, of necessity there takes place a change of law also.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> For the one concerning whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar.",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, a tribe with reference to which Moses spoke nothing concerning priests.",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> And this is clearer still, if another priest arises according to the likeness of Melchizedek,",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> who has become such not on the basis of a law of physical requirement, but according to the power of an indestructible life.",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> For it is attested of Him, \"you are a priest forever according to the order of  melchizedek.\"",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> For, on the one hand, there is a setting aside of a former commandment because of its weakness and uselessness",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> (for the Law made nothing perfect), and on the other hand there is a bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God.",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> And inasmuch as it was not without an oath",
			"21": "<sup>21</sup> (for they indeed became priests without an oath, but He with an oath through the One who said to Him, \"the  Lord has sworn and  will not change  his mind, 'you are a priest  forever'\");",
			"22": "<sup>22</sup> so much the more also Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant.",
			"23": "<sup>23</sup> The former priests, on the one hand, existed in greater numbers because they were prevented by death from continuing,",
			"24": "<sup>24</sup> but Jesus, on the other hand, because He continues forever, holds His priesthood permanently.",
			"25": "<sup>25</sup> Therefore He is able also to save forever those who draw near to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them.",
			"26": "<sup>26</sup> For it was fitting for us to have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners and exalted above the heavens;",
			"27": "<sup>27</sup> who does not need daily, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for His own sins and then for the sins of the people, because this He did once for all when He offered up Himself.",
			"28": "<sup>28</sup> For the Law appoints men as high priests who are weak, but the word of the oath, which came after the Law, appoints a Son, made perfect forever."
		},

			"1": "<sup>1</sup> Now the main point in what has been said is this: we have such a high priest, who has taken His seat at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,",
			"2": "<sup>2</sup> a minister in the sanctuary and in the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; so it is necessary that this high priest also have something to offer.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> Now if He were on earth, He would not be a priest at all, since there are those who offer the gifts according to the Law;",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, just as Moses was warned by God when he was about to erect the tabernacle; for, \"see,\" He says, \"that you make all things according to the pattern which was shown you on the  mountain.\"",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry, by as much as He is also the mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted on better promises.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion sought for a second.",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> For finding fault with them, He says, \"behold, days are coming, says the  Lord, when I will effect  a new covenant with the house of  israel and with the house of  judah;",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> not like the covenant which I made with  their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of  egypt; for they did not continue in  my covenant, and I did not care for them, says the  Lord.",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> \"for this is the covenant that  i will  make with the house of  israel after those days, says the  Lord: I will put  my laws into their minds, and I will write them  on their hearts. and I will be their  God, and they shall be  my people.",

			"3": "<sup>3</sup> Behind the second veil there was a tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies,",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> having a golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, in which was a golden jar holding the manna, and Aaron's rod which budded, and the tables of the covenant;",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> and above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat; but of these things we cannot now speak in detail.",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> Now when these things have been so prepared, the priests are continually entering the outer tabernacle performing the divine worship,",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> but into the second, only the high priest enters once a year, not without taking blood, which he offers for himself and for the sins of the people committed in ignorance.",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> The Holy Spirit is signifying this, that the way into the holy place has not yet been disclosed while the outer tabernacle is still standing,",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> which is a symbol for the present time. Accordingly both gifts and sacrifices are offered which cannot make the worshiper perfect in conscience,",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> since they relate only to food and drink and various washings, regulations for the body imposed until a time of reformation.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things to come, He entered through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation;",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> and not through the blood of goats and calves, but through His own blood, He entered the holy place once for all, having obtained eternal redemption.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled sanctify for the cleansing of the flesh,",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> For this reason He is the mediator of a new covenant, so that, since a death has taken place for the redemption of the transgressions that were committed under the first covenant, those who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> For where a covenant is, there must of necessity be the death of the one who made it.",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> For a covenant is valid only when men are dead, for it is never in force while the one who made it lives.",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> Therefore even the first covenant was not inaugurated without blood.",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the Law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> saying, \"this is the blood of the covenant  which  God commanded you.\"",
			"21": "<sup>21</sup> And in the same way he sprinkled both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry with the blood.",
			"22": "<sup>22</sup> And according to the Law, one may almost say, all things are cleansed with blood, and without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.",
			"23": "<sup>23</sup> Therefore it was necessary for the copies of the things in the heavens to be cleansed with these, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.",
			"24": "<sup>24</sup> For Christ did not enter a holy place made with hands, a mere copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us;",
			"25": "<sup>25</sup> nor was it that He would offer Himself often, as the high priest enters the holy place year by year with blood that is not his own.",
			"26": "<sup>26</sup> Otherwise, He would have needed to suffer often since the foundation of the world; but now once at the consummation of the ages He has been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself.",
			"27": "<sup>27</sup> And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once and after this comes judgment,",
			"28": "<sup>28</sup> so Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time for salvation without reference to sin, to those who eagerly await Him."
		},
		"10": {

			"3": "<sup>3</sup> But in those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year by year.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.",

			"12": "<sup>12</sup> but He, having offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, sat down at the right hand of  God,",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> waiting from that time onward until  his  enemies be made a footstool for  his feet.",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> For by one offering He has perfected for all time those who are sanctified.",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us; for after saying,",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> \"this is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the  Lord: I will put  my laws upon their heart, and on their mind I will write them,\" He then says,",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> \"and their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more.\"",

			"23": "<sup>23</sup> Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful;",
			"24": "<sup>24</sup> and let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds,",
			"25": "<sup>25</sup> not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more as you see the day drawing near.",
			"26": "<sup>26</sup> For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,",
			"27": "<sup>27</sup> but a terrifying expectation of judgment and the  fury of a fire which will consume the adversaries.",
			"28": "<sup>28</sup> Anyone who has set aside the Law of Moses dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.",
