			"1": "<sup>1</sup> In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it.",
			"2": "<sup>2</sup> The Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, along with some of the vessels of the house of God; and he brought them to the land of Shinar, to the house of his god, and he brought the vessels into the treasury of his god.",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> Then the king ordered Ashpenaz, the chief of his officials, to bring in some of the sons of Israel, including some of the royal family and of the nobles,",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> youths in whom was no defect, who were good-looking, showing intelligence in every branch of wisdom, endowed with understanding and discerning knowledge, and who had ability for serving in the king's court; and he ordered him to teach them the literature and language of the Chaldeans.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> The king appointed for them a daily ration from the king's choice food and from the wine which he drank, and appointed that they should be educated three years, at the end of which they were to enter the king's personal service.",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> Now among them from the sons of Judah were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> Then the commander of the officials assigned new names to them; and to Daniel he assigned the name Belteshazzar, to Hananiah Shadrach, to Mishael Meshach and to Azariah Abed-nego.",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> But Daniel made up his mind that he would not defile himself with the king's choice food or with the wine which he drank; so he sought permission from the commander of the officials that he might not defile himself.",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> Now God granted Daniel favor and compassion in the sight of the commander of the officials,",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> and the commander of the officials said to Daniel, \"I am afraid of my lord the king, who has appointed your food and your drink; for why should he see your faces looking more haggard than the youths who are your own age? Then you would make me forfeit my head to the king.\"",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> But Daniel said to the overseer whom the commander of the officials had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah,",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> \"Please test your servants for ten days, and let us be given some vegetables to eat and water to drink.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> Then let our appearance be observed in your presence and the appearance of the youths who are eating the king's choice food; and deal with your servants according to what you see.\"",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> So he listened to them in this matter and tested them for ten days.",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> At the end of ten days their appearance seemed better and they were fatter than all the youths who had been eating the king's choice food.",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> So the overseer continued to withhold their choice food and the wine they were to drink, and kept giving them vegetables.",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> As for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and intelligence in every branch of literature and wisdom; Daniel even understood all kinds of visions and dreams.",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> Then at the end of the days which the king had specified for presenting them, the commander of the officials presented them before Nebuchadnezzar.",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> The king talked with them, and out of them all not one was found like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah; so they entered the king's personal service.",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> As for every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king consulted them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and conjurers who were in all his realm.",
			"21": "<sup>21</sup> And Daniel continued until the first year of Cyrus the king."

			"1": "<sup>1</sup> Now in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; and his spirit was troubled and his sleep left him.",
			"2": "<sup>2</sup> Then the king gave orders to call in the magicians, the conjurers, the sorcerers and the Chaldeans to tell the king his dreams. So they came in and stood before the king.",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> The king said to them, \"I had a dream and my spirit is anxious to understand the dream.\"",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Aramaic: \"O king, live forever! Tell the dream to your servants, and we will declare the interpretation.\"",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> The king replied to the Chaldeans, \"The command from me is firm: if you do not make known to me the dream and its interpretation, you will be torn limb from limb and your houses will be made a rubbish heap.",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> But if you declare the dream and its interpretation, you will receive from me gifts and a reward and great honor; therefore declare to me the dream and its interpretation.\"",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> They answered a second time and said, \"Let the king tell the dream to his servants, and we will declare the interpretation.\"",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> The king replied, \"I know for certain that you are bargaining for time, inasmuch as you have seen that the command from me is firm,",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> that if you do not make the dream known to me, there is only one decree for you. For you have agreed together to speak lying and corrupt words before me until the situation is changed; therefore tell me the dream, that I may know that you can declare to me its interpretation.\"",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> The Chaldeans answered the king and said, \"There is not a man on earth who could declare the matter for the king, inasmuch as no great king or ruler has ever asked anything like this of any magician, conjurer or Chaldean.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> Moreover, the thing which the king demands is difficult, and there is no one else who could declare it to the king except gods, whose dwelling place is not with mortal flesh.\"",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> Because of this the king became indignant and very furious and gave orders to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> So the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they looked for Daniel and his friends to kill them.",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> Then Daniel replied with discretion and discernment to Arioch, the captain of the king's bodyguard, who had gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon;",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> he said to Arioch, the king's commander, \"For what reason is the decree from the king so urgent?\" Then Arioch informed Daniel about the matter.",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> So Daniel went in and requested of the king that he would give him time, in order that he might declare the interpretation to the king.",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> Then Daniel went to his house and informed his friends, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, about the matter,",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> so that they might request compassion from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that Daniel and his friends would not be destroyed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> Then the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven;",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> Daniel said, \"Let the name of God be blessed forever and ever, For wisdom and power belong to Him.",
			"21": "<sup>21</sup> \"It is He who changes the times and the epochs; He removes kings and establishes kings; He gives wisdom to wise men And knowledge to men of understanding.",
			"22": "<sup>22</sup> \"It is He who reveals the profound and hidden things; He knows what is in the darkness, And the light dwells with Him.",
			"23": "<sup>23</sup> \"To You, O God of my fathers, I give thanks and praise, For You have given me wisdom and power; Even now You have made known to me what we requested of You, For You have made known to us the king's matter.\"",
			"24": "<sup>24</sup> Therefore, Daniel went in to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and spoke to him as follows: \"Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon! Take me into the king's presence, and I will declare the interpretation to the king.\"",
			"25": "<sup>25</sup> Then Arioch hurriedly brought Daniel into the king's presence and spoke to him as follows: \"I have found a man among the exiles from Judah who can make the interpretation known to the king!\"",
			"26": "<sup>26</sup> The king said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, \"Are you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen and its interpretation?\"",
			"27": "<sup>27</sup> Daniel answered before the king and said, \"As for the mystery about which the king has inquired, neither wise men, conjurers, magicians nor diviners are able to declare it to the king.",
			"28": "<sup>28</sup> However, there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and He has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will take place in the latter days. This was your dream and the visions in your mind while on your bed.",
			"29": "<sup>29</sup> As for you, O king, while on your bed your thoughts turned to what would take place in the future; and He who reveals mysteries has made known to you what will take place.",
			"30": "<sup>30</sup> But as for me, this mystery has not been revealed to me for any wisdom residing in me more than in any other living man, but for the purpose of making the interpretation known to the king, and that you may understand the thoughts of your mind.",
			"31": "<sup>31</sup> \"You, O king, were looking and behold, there was a single great statue; that statue, which was large and of extraordinary splendor, was standing in front of you, and its appearance was awesome.",
			"32": "<sup>32</sup> The head of that statue was made of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of bronze,",
			"33": "<sup>33</sup> its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay.",
			"34": "<sup>34</sup> You continued looking until a stone was cut out without hands, and it struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and crushed them.",
			"35": "<sup>35</sup> Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were crushed all at the same time and became like chaff from the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away so that not a trace of them was found. But the stone that struck the statue became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.",
			"36": "<sup>36</sup> \"This was the dream; now we will tell its interpretation before the king.",
			"37": "<sup>37</sup> You, O king, are the king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, the strength and the glory;",
			"38": "<sup>38</sup> and wherever the sons of men dwell, or the beasts of the field, or the birds of the sky, He has given them into your hand and has caused you to rule over them all. You are the head of gold.",
			"39": "<sup>39</sup> After you there will arise another kingdom inferior to you, then another third kingdom of bronze, which will rule over all the earth.",
			"40": "<sup>40</sup> Then there will be a fourth kingdom as strong as iron; inasmuch as iron crushes and shatters all things, so, like iron that breaks in pieces, it will crush and break all these in pieces.",
			"41": "<sup>41</sup> In that you saw the feet and toes, partly of potter's clay and partly of iron, it will be a divided kingdom; but it will have in it the toughness of iron, inasmuch as you saw the iron mixed with common clay.",
			"42": "<sup>42</sup> As the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of pottery, so some of the kingdom will be strong and part of it will be brittle.",
			"43": "<sup>43</sup> And in that you saw the iron mixed with common clay, they will combine with one another in the seed of men; but they will not adhere to one another, even as iron does not combine with pottery.",
			"44": "<sup>44</sup> In the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom which will never be destroyed, and that kingdom will not be left for another people; it will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms, but it will itself endure forever.",
			"45": "<sup>45</sup> Inasmuch as you saw that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that it crushed the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver and the gold, the great God has made known to the king what will take place in the future; so the dream is true and its interpretation is trustworthy.\"",
			"46": "<sup>46</sup> Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face and did homage to Daniel, and gave orders to present to him an offering and fragrant incense.",
			"47": "<sup>47</sup> The king answered Daniel and said, \"Surely your God is a God of gods and a Lord of kings and a revealer of mysteries, since you have been able to reveal this mystery.\"",
			"48": "<sup>48</sup> Then the king promoted Daniel and gave him many great gifts, and he made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon.",
			"49": "<sup>49</sup> And Daniel made request of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego over the administration of the province of Babylon, while Daniel was at the king's court."

			"1": "<sup>1</sup> Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, the height of which was sixty cubits and its width six cubits; he set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon.",
			"2": "<sup>2</sup> Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent word to assemble the satraps, the prefects and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates and all the rulers of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> Then the satraps, the prefects and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates and all the rulers of the provinces were assembled for the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> Then the herald loudly proclaimed: \"To you the command is given, O peoples, nations and men of every language,",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> that at the moment you hear the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, psaltery, bagpipe and all kinds of music, you are to fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up.",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> But whoever does not fall down and worship shall immediately be cast into the midst of a furnace of blazing fire.\"",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> Therefore at that time, when all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, psaltery, bagpipe and all kinds of music, all the peoples, nations and men of every language fell down and worshiped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> For this reason at that time certain Chaldeans came forward and brought charges against the Jews.",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> They responded and said to Nebuchadnezzar the king: \"O king, live forever!",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> You, O king, have made a decree that every man who hears the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, psaltery, and bagpipe and all kinds of music, is to fall down and worship the golden image.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> But whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast into the midst of a furnace of blazing fire.",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> There are certain Jews whom you have appointed over the administration of the province of Babylon, namely Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego. These men, O king, have disregarded you; they do not serve your gods or worship the golden image which you have set up.\"",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> Then Nebuchadnezzar in rage and anger gave orders to bring Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego; then these men were brought before the king.",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> Nebuchadnezzar responded and said to them, \"Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the golden image that I have set up?",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> Now if you are ready, at the moment you hear the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, psaltery and bagpipe and all kinds of music, to fall down and worship the image that I have made, very well. But if you do not worship, you will immediately be cast into the midst of a furnace of blazing fire; and what god is there who can deliver you out of my hands?\"",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego replied to the king, \"O Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to give you an answer concerning this matter.",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the furnace of blazing fire; and He will deliver us out of your hand, O king.",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> But even if He does not, let it be known to you, O king, that we are not going to serve your gods or worship the golden image that you have set up.\"",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with wrath, and his facial expression was altered toward Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego. He answered by giving orders to heat the furnace seven times more than it was usually heated.",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> He commanded certain valiant warriors who were in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego in order to cast them into the furnace of blazing fire.",
			"21": "<sup>21</sup> Then these men were tied up in their trousers, their coats, their caps and their other clothes, and were cast into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire.",
			"22": "<sup>22</sup> For this reason, because the king's command was urgent and the furnace had been made extremely hot, the flame of the fire slew those men who carried up Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego.",
			"23": "<sup>23</sup> But these three men, Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, fell into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire still tied up.",
			"24": "<sup>24</sup> Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astounded and stood up in haste; he said to his high officials, \"Was it not three men we cast bound into the midst of the fire?\" They replied to the king, \"Certainly, O king.\"",
			"25": "<sup>25</sup> He said, \"Look! I see four men loosed and walking about in the midst of the fire without harm, and the appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods!\"",
			"26": "<sup>26</sup> Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the door of the furnace of blazing fire; he responded and said, \"Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, come out, you servants of the Most High God, and come here!\" Then Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego came out of the midst of the fire.",
			"27": "<sup>27</sup> The satraps, the prefects, the governors and the king's high officials gathered around and saw in regard to these men that the fire had no effect on the bodies of these men nor was the hair of their head singed, nor were their trousers damaged, nor had the smell of fire even come upon them.",
			"28": "<sup>28</sup> Nebuchadnezzar responded and said, \"Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, who has sent His angel and delivered His servants who put their trust in Him, violating the king's command, and yielded up their bodies so as not to serve or worship any god except their own God.",
			"29": "<sup>29</sup> Therefore I make a decree that any people, nation or tongue that speaks anything offensive against the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego shall be torn limb from limb and their houses reduced to a rubbish heap, inasmuch as there is no other god who is able to deliver in this way.\"",
