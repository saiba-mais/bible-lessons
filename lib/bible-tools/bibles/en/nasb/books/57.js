			"1": "<sup>1</sup> Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our beloved brother and fellow worker,",
			"2": "<sup>2</sup> and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> because I hear of your love and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints;",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> and I pray that the fellowship of your faith may become effective through the knowledge of every good thing which is in you for Christ's sake.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> For I have come to have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> Therefore, though I have enough confidence in Christ to order you to do what is proper,",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> yet for love's sake I rather appeal to you-since I am such a person as Paul, the aged, and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus-",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> I appeal to you for my child Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my imprisonment,",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> who formerly was useless to you, but now is useful both to you and to me.",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> I have sent him back to you in person, that is, sending my very heart,",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> whom I wished to keep with me, so that on your behalf he might minister to me in my imprisonment for the gospel;",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> but without your consent I did not want to do anything, so that your goodness would not be, in effect, by compulsion but of your own free will.",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> For perhaps he was for this reason separated from you for a while, that you would have him back forever,",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> If then you regard me a partner, accept him as you would me.",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> But if he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything, charge that to my account;",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand, I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self as well).",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> Yes, brother, let me benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.",
			"21": "<sup>21</sup> Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, since I know that you will do even more than what I say.",
			"22": "<sup>22</sup> At the same time also prepare me a lodging, for I hope that through your prayers I will be given to you.",
			"23": "<sup>23</sup> Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,",
			"24": "<sup>24</sup> as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow workers.",
			"25": "<sup>25</sup> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit."
