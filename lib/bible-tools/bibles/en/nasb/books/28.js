			"3": "<sup>3</sup> So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> And the Lord said to him, \"Name him Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will punish the house of Jehu for the bloodshed of Jezreel, and I will put an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> On that day I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.\"",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> Then she conceived again and gave birth to a daughter. And the Lord said to him, \"Name her Lo-ruhamah, for I will no longer have compassion on the house of Israel, that I would ever forgive them.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> But I will have compassion on the house of Judah and deliver them by the Lord their God, and will not deliver them by bow, sword, battle, horses or horsemen.\"",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> When she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived and gave birth to a son.",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> And the Lord said, \"Name him Lo-ammi, for you are not My people and I am not your God.\"",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> Yet the number of the sons of Israel Will be like the sand of the sea, Which cannot be measured or numbered; And in the place Where it is said to them, \"You are not My people,\" It will be said to them, \"You are the sons of the living God.\"",

			"11": "<sup>11</sup> \"I will also put an end to all her gaiety, Her feasts, her new moons, her sabbaths And all her festal assemblies.",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> \"I will destroy her vines and fig trees, Of which she said, 'These are my wages Which my lovers have given me.' And I will make them a forest, And the beasts of the field will devour them.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> \"I will punish her for the days of the Baals When she used to offer sacrifices to them And adorn herself with her earrings and jewelry, And follow her lovers, so that she forgot Me,\" declares the Lord.",

			"16": "<sup>16</sup> \"It will come about in that day,\" declares the Lord, \"That you will call Me Ishi And will no longer call Me Baali.",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> \"For I will remove the names of the Baals from her mouth, So that they will be mentioned by their names no more.",

			"22": "<sup>22</sup> And the earth will respond to the grain, to the new wine and to the oil, And they will respond to Jezreel.",
			"23": "<sup>23</sup> \"I will sow her for Myself in the land. I will also have compassion on her who had not obtained compassion, And I will say to those who were not My people, 'You are My people!' And they will say, 'You are my God!'\""
