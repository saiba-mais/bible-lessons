			"9": "<sup>9</sup> He said to his people, \"Behold, the people of the sons of Israel are more and mightier than we.",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> Come, let us deal wisely with them, or else they will multiply and in the event of war, they will also join themselves to those who hate us, and fight against us and depart from the land.\"",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> So they appointed taskmasters over them to afflict them with hard labor. And they built for Pharaoh storage cities, Pithom and Raamses.",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread out, so that they were in dread of the sons of Israel.",

			"16": "<sup>16</sup> and he said, \"When you are helping the Hebrew women to give birth and see them upon the birthstool, if it is a son, then you shall put him to death; but if it is a daughter, then she shall live.\"",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> But the midwives feared God, and did not do as the king of Egypt had commanded them, but let the boys live.",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> So the king of Egypt called for the midwives and said to them, \"Why have you done this thing, and let the boys live?\"",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> The midwives said to Pharaoh, \"Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are vigorous and give birth before the midwife can get to them.\"",

			"8": "<sup>8</sup> Pharaoh's daughter said to her, \"Go ahead.\" So the girl went and called the child's mother.",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> Then Pharaoh's daughter said to her, \"Take this child away and nurse him for me and I will give you your wages.\" So the woman took the child and nursed him.",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> The child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter and he became her son. And she named him Moses, and said, \"Because I drew him out of the water.\"",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> Now it came about in those days, when Moses had grown up, that he went out to his brethren and looked on their hard labors; and he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his brethren.",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> So he looked this way and that, and when he saw there was no one around, he struck down the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> He went out the next day, and behold, two Hebrews were fighting with each other; and he said to the offender, \"Why are you striking your companion?\"",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> But he said, \"Who made you a prince or a judge over us? Are you intending to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?\" Then Moses was afraid and said, \"Surely the matter has become known.\"",

			"18": "<sup>18</sup> When they came to Reuel their father, he said, \"Why have you come back so soon today?\"",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> So they said, \"An Egyptian delivered us from the hand of the shepherds, and what is more, he even drew the water for us and watered the flock.\"",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> He said to his daughters, \"Where is he then? Why is it that you have left the man behind? Invite him to have something to eat.\"",
			"21": "<sup>21</sup> Moses was willing to dwell with the man, and he gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses.",

			"23": "<sup>23</sup> Now it came about in the course of those many days that the king of Egypt died. And the sons of Israel sighed because of the bondage, and they cried out; and their cry for help because of their bondage rose up to God.",
			"24": "<sup>24</sup> So God heard their groaning; and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.",

			"3": "<sup>3</sup> So Moses said, \"I must turn aside now and see this marvelous sight, why the bush is not burned up.\"",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> When the Lord saw that he turned aside to look, God called to him from the midst of the bush and said, \"Moses, Moses!\" And he said, \"Here I am.\"",

So now, please, let us go a three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God.'",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> But I know that the king of Egypt will not permit you to go, except under compulsion.",

			"10": "<sup>10</sup> Then Moses said to the Lord, \"Please, Lord, I have never been eloquent, neither recently nor in time past, nor since You have spoken to Your servant; for I am slow of speech and slow of tongue.\"",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> The Lord said to him, \"Who has made man's mouth? Or who makes him mute or deaf, or seeing or blind? Is it not I, the Lord?",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> Now then go, and I, even I, will be with your mouth, and teach you what you are to say.\"",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> But he said, \"Please, Lord, now send the message by whomever You will.\"",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> Then the anger of the Lord burned against Moses, and He said, \"Is there not your brother Aaron the Levite? I know that he speaks fluently. And moreover, behold, he is coming out to meet you; when he sees you, he will be glad in his heart.",

			"18": "<sup>18</sup> Then Moses departed and returned to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him, \"Please, let me go, that I may return to my brethren who are in Egypt, and see if they are still alive.\" And Jethro said to Moses, \"Go in peace.\"",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> Now the Lord said to Moses in Midian, \"Go back to Egypt, for all the men who were seeking your life are dead.\"",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> So Moses took his wife and his sons and mounted them on a donkey, and returned to the land of Egypt. Moses also took the staff of God in his hand.",
			"21": "<sup>21</sup> The Lord said to Moses, \"When you go back to Egypt see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put in your power; but I will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go.",
			"22": "<sup>22</sup> Then you shall say to Pharaoh, 'Thus says the Lord, \"Israel is My son, My firstborn.",

			"24": "<sup>24</sup> Now it came about at the lodging place on the way that the Lord met him and sought to put him to death.",
			"25": "<sup>25</sup> Then Zipporah took a flint and cut off her son's foreskin and threw it at Moses' feet, and she said, \"You are indeed a bridegroom of blood to me.\"",
			"26": "<sup>26</sup> So He let him alone. At that time she said, \"You are a bridegroom of blood\"-because of the circumcision.",

			"28": "<sup>28</sup> Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord with which He had sent him, and all the signs that He had commanded him to do.",

			"8": "<sup>8</sup> But the quota of bricks which they were making previously, you shall impose on them; you are not to reduce any of it. Because they are lazy, therefore they cry out, 'Let us go and sacrifice to our God.'",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> Let the labor be heavier on the men, and let them work at it so that they will pay no attention to false words.\"",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> So the taskmasters of the people and their foremen went out and spoke to the people, saying, \"Thus says Pharaoh, 'I am not going to give you any straw.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> You go and get straw for yourselves wherever you can find it, but none of your labor will be reduced.'\"",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> So the people scattered through all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> The taskmasters pressed them, saying, \"Complete your work quota, your daily amount, just as when you had straw.\"",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> Moreover, the foremen of the sons of Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten and were asked, \"Why have you not completed your required amount either yesterday or today in making brick as previously?\"",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> Then the foremen of the sons of Israel came and cried out to Pharaoh, saying, \"Why do you deal this way with your servants?",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> There is no straw given to your servants, yet they keep saying to us, 'Make bricks!' And behold, your servants are being beaten; but it is the fault of your own people.\"",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> But he said, \"You are lazy, very lazy; therefore you say, 'Let us go and sacrifice to the Lord.'",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> So go now and work; for you will be given no straw, yet you must deliver the quota of bricks.\"",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> The foremen of the sons of Israel saw that they were in trouble because they were told, \"You must not reduce your daily amount of bricks.\"",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> When they left Pharaoh's presence, they met Moses and Aaron as they were waiting for them.",
			"21": "<sup>21</sup> They said to them, \"May the Lord look upon you and judge you, for you have made us odious in Pharaoh's sight and in the sight of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to kill us.\"",
			"22": "<sup>22</sup> Then Moses returned to the Lord and said, \"O Lord, why have You brought harm to this people? Why did You ever send me?",
			"23": "<sup>23</sup> Ever since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he has done harm to this people, and You have not delivered Your people at all.\""
