			"3": "<sup>3</sup> To these He also presented Himself alive after His suffering, by many convincing proofs, appearing to them over a period of forty days and speaking of the things concerning the kingdom of God.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> Gathering them together, He commanded them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for what the Father had promised, \"Which,\"  He said,  \"you heard of from Me;",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.\"",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> So when they had come together, they were asking Him, saying, \"Lord, is it at this time You are restoring the kingdom to Israel?\"",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> He said to them, \"It is not for you to know times or epochs which the Father has fixed by His own authority;",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and even to the remotest part of the earth.\"",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> And after He had said these things, He was lifted up while they were looking on, and a cloud received Him out of their sight.",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> And as they were gazing intently into the sky while He was going, behold, two men in white clothing stood beside them.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> They also said, \"Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into the sky? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in just the same way as you have watched Him go into heaven.\"",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> When they had entered the city, they went up to the upper room where they were staying; that is, Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas the  son of James.",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> These all with one mind were continually devoting themselves to prayer, along with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brothers.",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> At this time Peter stood up in the midst of the brethren (a gathering of about one hundred and twenty persons was there together), and said,",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> \"Brethren, the Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit foretold by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus.",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> For he was counted among us and received his share in this ministry.\"",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> (Now this man acquired a field with the price of his wickedness, and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his intestines gushed out.",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> And it became known to all who were living in Jerusalem; so that in their own language that field was called Hakeldama, that is, Field of Blood.)",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> \"For it is written in the book of Psalms, 'Let his homestead be made desolate, and let no one dwell in it'; and, 'Let another man take his office.'",
			"21": "<sup>21</sup> Therefore it is necessary that of the men who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us-",
			"22": "<sup>22</sup> beginning with the baptism of John until the day that He was taken up from us-one of these must become a witness with us of His resurrection.\"",
			"23": "<sup>23</sup> So they put forward two men, Joseph called Barsabbas (who was also called Justus), and Matthias.",
			"24": "<sup>24</sup> And they prayed and said, \"You, Lord, who know the hearts of all men, show which one of these two You have chosen",
			"25": "<sup>25</sup> to occupy this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place.\"",
			"26": "<sup>26</sup> And they drew lots for them, and the lot fell to Matthias; and he was added to the eleven apostles."

			"3": "<sup>3</sup> And there appeared to them tongues as of fire distributing themselves, and they rested on each one of them.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit was giving them utterance.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> Now there were Jews living in Jerusalem, devout men from every nation under heaven.",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> And when this sound occurred, the crowd came together, and were bewildered because each one of them was hearing them speak in his own language.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> They were amazed and astonished, saying, \"Why, are not all these who are speaking Galileans?",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> And how is it that we each hear them in our own language to which we were born?",

			"23": "<sup>23</sup> this Man, delivered over by the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God, you nailed to a cross by the hands of godless men and put Him to death.",
			"24": "<sup>24</sup> But God raised Him up again, putting an end to the agony of death, since it was impossible for Him to be held in its power.",
			"25": "<sup>25</sup> For David says of Him, 'I saw the  Lord always in my presence; for  he is at my right hand, so that I will not be shaken.",
			"26": "<sup>26</sup> 'therefore my heart was glad and my tongue exulted; moreover my flesh also will live in hope;",
			"27": "<sup>27</sup> because  you will not abandon my soul to  hades, nor  allow  your  holy  one to  undergo decay.",
			"28": "<sup>28</sup> 'you have made known to me the ways of life; you will make me full of gladness with  your presence.'",
			"29": "<sup>29</sup> \"Brethren, I may confidently say to you regarding the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.",
			"30": "<sup>30</sup> And so, because he was a prophet and knew that God had sworn to him with an oath to seat  one  of his descendants on his throne,",
			"31": "<sup>31</sup> he looked ahead and spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that he was neither abandoned to  hades, nor did His flesh suffer decay.",
			"32": "<sup>32</sup> This Jesus God raised up again, to which we are all witnesses.",
			"33": "<sup>33</sup> Therefore having been exalted to the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, He has poured forth this which you both see and hear.",
			"34": "<sup>34</sup> For it was not David who ascended into heaven, but he himself says: 'the  Lord said to my  Lord, \"sit at  my right hand,",
			"35": "<sup>35</sup> until I make  your enemies a footstool for  your feet.\"'",
			"36": "<sup>36</sup> Therefore let all the house of Israel know for certain that God has made Him both Lord and Christ-this Jesus whom you crucified.\"",
			"37": "<sup>37</sup> Now when they heard this, they were pierced to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, \"Brethren, what shall we do?\"",
			"38": "<sup>38</sup> Peter said to them, \"Repent, and each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.",
			"39": "<sup>39</sup> For the promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off, as many as the Lord our God will call to Himself.\"",
			"40": "<sup>40</sup> And with many other words he solemnly testified and kept on exhorting them, saying, \"Be saved from this perverse generation!\"",
			"41": "<sup>41</sup> So then, those who had received his word were baptized; and that day there were added about three thousand souls.",
			"42": "<sup>42</sup> They were continually devoting themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.",
			"43": "<sup>43</sup> Everyone kept feeling a sense of awe; and many wonders and signs were taking place through the apostles.",
			"44": "<sup>44</sup> And all those who had believed were together and had all things in common;",

			"1": "<sup>1</sup> When they had been brought safely through, then we found out that the island was called Malta.",
			"2": "<sup>2</sup> The natives showed us extraordinary kindness; for because of the rain that had set in and because of the cold, they kindled a fire and received us all.",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat and fastened itself on his hand.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> When the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they began saying to one another, \"Undoubtedly this man is a murderer, and though he has been saved from the sea, justice has not allowed him to live.\"",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> However he shook the creature off into the fire and suffered no harm.",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> But they were expecting that he was about to swell up or suddenly fall down dead. But after they had waited a long time and had seen nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and began to say that he was a god.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the leading man of the island, named Publius, who welcomed us and entertained us courteously three days.",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> And it happened that the father of Publius was lying in bed afflicted with recurrent fever and dysentery; and Paul went in to see him and after he had prayed, he laid his hands on him and healed him.",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> After this had happened, the rest of the people on the island who had diseases were coming to him and getting cured.",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> They also honored us with many marks of respect; and when we were setting sail, they supplied us with all we needed.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> At the end of three months we set sail on an Alexandrian ship which had wintered at the island, and which had the Twin Brothers for its figurehead.",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> After we put in at Syracuse, we stayed there for three days.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> From there we sailed around and arrived at Rhegium, and a day later a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli.",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> There we found some brethren, and were invited to stay with them for seven days; and thus we came to Rome.",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> And the brethren, when they heard about us, came from there as far as the Market of Appius and Three Inns to meet us; and when Paul saw them, he thanked God and took courage.",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> When we entered Rome, Paul was allowed to stay by himself, with the soldier who was guarding him.",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> After three days Paul called together those who were the leading men of the Jews, and when they came together, he began saying to them, \"Brethren, though I had done nothing against our people or the customs of our fathers, yet I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> And when they had examined me, they were willing to release me because there was no ground for putting me to death.",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> But when the Jews objected, I was forced to appeal to Caesar, not that I had any accusation against my nation.",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> For this reason, therefore, I requested to see you and to speak with you, for I am wearing this chain for the sake of the hope of Israel.\"",
			"21": "<sup>21</sup> They said to him, \"We have neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor have any of the brethren come here and reported or spoken anything bad about you.",
			"22": "<sup>22</sup> But we desire to hear from you what your views are; for concerning this sect, it is known to us that it is spoken against everywhere.\"",
			"23": "<sup>23</sup> When they had set a day for Paul, they came to him at his lodging in large numbers; and he was explaining to them by solemnly testifying about the kingdom of God and trying to persuade them concerning Jesus, from both the Law of Moses and from the Prophets, from morning until evening.",
			"24": "<sup>24</sup> Some were being persuaded by the things spoken, but others would not believe.",
			"25": "<sup>25</sup> And when they did not agree with one another, they began leaving after Paul had spoken one parting word, \"The Holy Spirit rightly spoke through Isaiah the prophet to your fathers,",

			"27": "<sup>27</sup> for the heart of this people has become dull, and with their ears they scarcely hear, and they have closed their eyes; otherwise they might see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart and return, and I would heal them.\"'",
