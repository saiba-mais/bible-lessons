			"4": "<sup>4</sup> \"So I will stretch out My hand against Judah And against all the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, And the names of the idolatrous priests along with the priests.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> \"And those who bow down on the housetops to the host of heaven, And those who bow down and swear to the Lord and yet swear by Milcom,",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> And those who have turned back from following the Lord, And those who have not sought the Lord or inquired of Him.\"",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> Be silent before the Lord God! For the day of the Lord is near, For the Lord has prepared a sacrifice, He has consecrated His guests.",

			"14": "<sup>14</sup> Near is the great day of the Lord, Near and coming very quickly; Listen, the day of the Lord! In it the warrior cries out bitterly.",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> A day of wrath is that day, A day of trouble and distress, A day of destruction and desolation, A day of darkness and gloom, A day of clouds and thick darkness,",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> A day of trumpet and battle cry Against the fortified cities And the high corner towers.",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> I will bring distress on men So that they will walk like the blind, Because they have sinned against the Lord; And their blood will be poured out like dust And their flesh like dung.",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> Neither their silver nor their gold Will be able to deliver them On the day of the Lord's wrath; And all the earth will be devoured In the fire of His jealousy, For He will make a complete end, Indeed a terrifying one, Of all the inhabitants of the earth."

			"9": "<sup>9</sup> \"Therefore, as I live,\" declares the Lord of hosts, The God of Israel, \"Surely Moab will be like Sodom And the sons of Ammon like Gomorrah- A place possessed by nettles and salt pits, And a perpetual desolation. The remnant of My people will plunder them And the remainder of My nation will inherit them.\"",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> This they will have in return for their pride, because they have taunted and become arrogant against the people of the Lord of hosts.",
