			"27": "<sup>27</sup> When your dread comes like a storm And your calamity comes like a whirlwind, When distress and anguish come upon you.",
			"28": "<sup>28</sup> \"Then they will call on me, but I will not answer; They will seek me diligently but they will not find me,",
			"29": "<sup>29</sup> Because they hated knowledge And did not choose the fear of the Lord.",
