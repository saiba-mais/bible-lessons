			"1": "<sup>1</sup> The elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth.",
			"2": "<sup>2</sup> Beloved, I pray that in all respects you may prosper and be in good health, just as your soul prospers.",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> For I was very glad when brethren came and testified to your truth, that is, how you are walking in truth.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> I have no greater joy than this, to hear of my children walking in the truth.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> Beloved, you are acting faithfully in whatever you accomplish for the brethren, and especially when they are strangers;",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> and they have testified to your love before the church. You will do well to send them on their way in a manner worthy of God.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> For they went out for the sake of the Name, accepting nothing from the Gentiles.",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> Therefore we ought to support such men, so that we may be fellow workers with the truth.",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> I wrote something to the church; but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, does not accept what we say.",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> For this reason, if I come, I will call attention to his deeds which he does, unjustly accusing us with wicked words; and not satisfied with this, he himself does not receive the brethren, either, and he forbids those who desire to do so and puts them out of the church.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. The one who does good is of God; the one who does evil has not seen God.",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> Demetrius has received a good testimony from everyone, and from the truth itself; and we add our testimony, and you know that our testimony is true.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> I had many things to write to you, but I am not willing to write them to you with pen and ink;",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> but I hope to see you shortly, and we will speak face to face.",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> Peace be to you. The friends greet you. Greet the friends by name."
