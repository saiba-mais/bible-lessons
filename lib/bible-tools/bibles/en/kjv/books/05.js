			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei:",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,",

			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.",

			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> our God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> our God doth give unto us.",

			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.",

			"34": "<sup class=\"versenum\">34 </sup>And the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying,",
			"35": "<sup class=\"versenum\">35 </sup>Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers.",
			"36": "<sup class=\"versenum\">36 </sup>Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.",
			"37": "<sup class=\"versenum\">37 </sup>Also the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither.",
			"38": "<sup class=\"versenum\">38 </sup>But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.",
			"39": "<sup class=\"versenum\">39 </sup>Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.",
			"40": "<sup class=\"versenum\">40 </sup>But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.",
			"41": "<sup class=\"versenum\">41 </sup>Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, we will go up and fight, according to all that the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill.",
			"42": "<sup class=\"versenum\">42 </sup>And the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> said unto me, Say unto them. Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.",
			"43": "<sup class=\"versenum\">43 </sup>So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, and went presumptuously up into the hill.",
			"44": "<sup class=\"versenum\">44 </sup>And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto Hormah.",
			"45": "<sup class=\"versenum\">45 </sup>And ye returned and wept before the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>; but the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.",

			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore:",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession.",

			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>For the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>And the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession.",

			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> gave unto them.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> sware unto them.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>For indeed the hand of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,",

			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession.",
