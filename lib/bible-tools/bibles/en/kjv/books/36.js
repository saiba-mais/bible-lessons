			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>I will consume man and beast; I will consume the fowls of the heaven, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumbling blocks with the wicked: and I will cut off man from off the land, saith the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>I will also stretch out mine hand upon Judah, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, and the name of the Chemarims with the priests;",
