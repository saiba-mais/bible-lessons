			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.",

			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus:",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another.",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>Neither give place to the devil.",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29 </sup>Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.",
			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30 </sup>And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.",
			"31": "<sup class=\"versenum\">31 </sup>Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:",

			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Be not ye therefore partakers with them.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light:",

			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;",

			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,",
			"27": "<sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.",
			"28": "<sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.",
			"29": "<sup class=\"versenum\">29 </sup>For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:",
			"30": "<sup class=\"versenum\">30 </sup>For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.",
			"31": "<sup class=\"versenum\">31 </sup>For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.",
			"32": "<sup class=\"versenum\">32 </sup>This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.",
			"33": "<sup class=\"versenum\">33 </sup>Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband."

			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;",

			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;",

			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts.",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
