			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">1 </span>There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, and Satan came also among them.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>And the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>And the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Then Satan answered the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>And the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> gave, and the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> hath taken away; blessed be the name of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly."

		"2": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">2 </span>Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>And the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>And the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>And Satan answered the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>And the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>So went Satan forth from the presence of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great."
		},
		"3": {
			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">3 </span>After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>And Job spake, and said,",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>With kings and counsellors of the earth, which build desolate places for themselves;",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul;",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came."

			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,",
