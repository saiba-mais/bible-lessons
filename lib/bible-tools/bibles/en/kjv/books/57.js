			"1": "<sup class=\"versenum\">1 </sup>Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.",
			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen."
