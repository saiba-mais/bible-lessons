			"1": "<span class=\"chapternum\">1 </span>How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how is she become as a widow! she that was great among the nations, and princess among the provinces, how is she become tributary!",
			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks: among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her: all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between the straits.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts: all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she is in bitterness.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: her children are gone into captivity before the enemy.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: her princes are become like harts that find no pasture, and they are gone without strength before the pursuer.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did help her: the adversaries saw her, and did mock at her sabbaths.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed: all that honoured her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Her filthiness is in her skirts; she remembereth not her last end; therefore she came down wonderfully: she had no comforter. O <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, behold my affliction: for the enemy hath magnified himself.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things: for she hath seen that the heathen entered into her sanctuary, whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thy congregation.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul: see, O <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, and consider; for I am become vile.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto me, wherewith the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>From above hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back: he hath made me desolate and faint all the day.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are wreathed, and come up upon my neck: he hath made my strength to fall, the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> hath delivered me into their hands, from whom I am not able to rise up.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>The <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> hath trodden under foot all my mighty men in the midst of me: he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men: the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, as in a winepress.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me: my children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>Zion spreadeth forth her hands, and there is none to comfort her: the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> hath commanded concerning Jacob, that his adversaries should be round about him: Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>The <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment: hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my sorrow: my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>I called for my lovers, but they deceived me: my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city, while they sought their meat to relieve their souls.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>Behold, O <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>; for I am in distress: my bowels are troubled; mine heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled: abroad the sword bereaveth, at home there is as death.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>They have heard that I sigh: there is none to comfort me: all mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done it: thou wilt bring the day that thou hast called, and they shall be like unto me.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions: for my sighs are many, and my heart is faint."

			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>The <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath not pitied: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of Judah; he hath brought them down to the ground: he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>He hath cut off in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, which devoureth round about.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right hand as an adversary, and slew all that were pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured out his fury like fire.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>The <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath swallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were of a garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>The <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary, he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, as in the day of a solemn feast.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>The <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion: he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament; they languished together.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her princes are among the Gentiles: the law is no more; her prophets also find no vision from the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, and keep silence: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded themselves with sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people; because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>They say to their mothers, Where is corn and wine? when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their soul was poured out into their mothers' bosom.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>What thing shall I take to witness for thee? what thing shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? for thy breach is great like the sea: who can heal thee?",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee: and they have not discovered thine iniquity, to turn away thy captivity; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>All that pass by clap their hands at thee; they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying, Is this the city that men call The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee: they hiss and gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed her up: certainly this is the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen it.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>The <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> hath done that which he had devised; he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old: he hath thrown down, and hath not pitied: and he hath caused thine enemy to rejoice over thee, he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>Their heart cried unto the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night: give thyself no rest; let not the apple of thine eye cease.",
			"19": "<sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water before the face of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>: lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger in the top of every street.",
			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>Behold, O <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, and consider to whom thou hast done this. Shall the women eat their fruit, and children of a span long? shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword; thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger; thou hast killed, and not pitied.",
			"22": "<sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so that in the day of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>'s anger none escaped nor remained: those that I have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed."
