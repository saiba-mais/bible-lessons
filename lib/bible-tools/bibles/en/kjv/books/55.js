			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;",

			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.",

			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me.",
			"18": "<sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well."

			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.",

			"20": "<sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.",
			"21": "<sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work.",

			"23": "<sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.",
			"24": "<sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient,",
			"25": "<sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;",
			"26": "<sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will."

			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as their's also was.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:",

			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.",
			"5": "<sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.",
			"6": "<sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.",
			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:",

			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:",
			"15": "<sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.",
			"16": "<sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.",
			"17": "<sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.",
