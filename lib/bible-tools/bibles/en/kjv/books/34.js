			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>The <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> is slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at all acquit the wicked: the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the rivers: Bashan languisheth, and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon languisheth.",

			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>What do ye imagine against the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>? he will make an utter end: affliction shall not rise up the second time.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>For while they be folden together as thorns, and while they are drunken as drunkards, they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry.",
			"11": "<sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>There is one come out of thee, that imagineth evil against the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>, a wicked counsellor.",
			"12": "<sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>Thus saith the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>; Though they be quiet, and likewise many, yet thus shall they be cut down, when he shall pass through. Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more.",
			"13": "<sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>For now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy bonds in sunder.",
			"14": "<sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>And the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> hath given a commandment concerning thee, that no more of thy name be sown: out of the house of thy gods will I cut off the graven image and the molten image: I will make thy grave; for thou art vile.",

			"2": "<sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>For the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\" class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> hath turned away the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel: for the emptiers have emptied them out, and marred their vine branches.",
			"3": "<sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet: the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the day of his preparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken.",
			"4": "<sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches, they shall run like the lightnings.",

			"7": "<sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>And it shall come to pass, that all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will bemoan her? whence shall I seek comforters for thee?",
			"8": "<sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Art thou better than populous No, that was situate among the rivers, that had the waters round about it, whose rampart was the sea, and her wall was from the sea?",
			"9": "<sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and it was infinite; Put and Lubim were thy helpers.",
			"10": "<sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Yet was she carried away, she went into captivity: her young children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets: and they cast lots for her honourable men, and all her great men were bound in chains.",
