			"1": "<sup>1</sup> The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. It came to pass in the month of Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the citadel,",
			"2": "<sup>2</sup> that Hanani one of my brethren came with men from Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped, who had survived the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> And they said to me, “The survivors who are left from the captivity in the province are there in great distress and reproach. The wall of Jerusalem is also broken down, and its gates are burned with fire.”",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> So it was, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned for  many days; I was fasting and praying before the God of heaven.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> And I said: “I pray, Lord God of heaven, O great and awesome God, You who keep Your covenant and mercy with those who love You and observe Your commandments,",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> please let Your ear be attentive and Your eyes open, that You may hear the prayer of Your servant which I pray before You now, day and night, for the children of Israel Your servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel which we have sinned against You. Both my father’s house and I have sinned.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> We have acted very corruptly against You, and have not kept the commandments, the statutes, nor the ordinances which You commanded Your servant Moses.",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> Remember, I pray, the word that You commanded Your servant Moses, saying, ‘If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the nations;",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> but if you return to Me, and keep My commandments and do them, though some of you were cast out to the farthest part of the heavens, yet I will gather them from there, and bring them to the place which I have chosen as a dwelling for My name.’",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> Now these are Your servants and Your people, whom You have redeemed by Your great power, and by Your strong hand.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> O Lord, I pray, please let Your ear be attentive to the prayer of Your servant, and to the prayer of Your servants who desire to fear Your name; and let Your servant prosper this day, I pray, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.” For I was the king’s cupbearer."

			"1": "<sup>1</sup> And it came to pass in the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when wine was before him, that I took the wine and gave it to the king. Now I had never been sad in his presence before.",
			"2": "<sup>2</sup> Therefore the king said to me, “Why is your face sad, since you are not sick? This is nothing but sorrow of heart.” So I became dreadfully afraid,",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> and said to the king, “May the king live forever! Why should my face not be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers’ tombs, lies waste, and its gates are burned with fire?”",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> Then the king said to me, “What do you request?” So I prayed to the God of heaven.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> And I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor in your sight, I ask that you send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers’ tombs, that I may rebuild it.”",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> Then the king said to me (the queen also sitting beside him), “How long will your journey be? And when will you return?” So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> Furthermore I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, let letters be given to me for the governors of  the  region beyond the River, that they must permit me to pass through till I come to Judah,",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king’s forest, that he must give me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel which pertains  to the temple, for the city wall, and for the house that I will occupy.” And the king granted them to me according to the good hand of my God upon me.",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> Then I went to the governors in  the  region beyond the River, and gave them the king’s letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me.",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard of  it, they were deeply disturbed that a man had come to seek the well-being of the children of Israel.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> So I came to Jerusalem and was there three days.",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> Then I arose in the night, I and a few men with me; I told no one what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem; nor was there any animal with me, except the one on which I rode.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> And I went out by night through the Valley Gate to the Serpent Well and the Refuse Gate, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down and its gates which were burned with fire.",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> Then I went on to the Fountain Gate and to the King’s Pool, but there  was no room for the animal under me to pass.",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> So I went up in the night by the valley, and viewed the wall; then I turned back and entered by the Valley Gate, and so returned.",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> And the officials did not know where I had gone or what I had done; I had not yet told the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the officials, or the others who did the work.",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> Then I said to them, “You see the distress that we are in, how Jerusalem lies waste, and its gates are burned with fire. Come and let us build the wall of Jerusalem, that we may no longer be a reproach.”",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> And I told them of the hand of my God which had been good upon me, and also of the king’s words that he had spoken to me. So they said, “Let us rise up and build.” Then they set their hands to this good work.",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official, and Geshem the Arab heard of  it, they laughed at us and despised us, and said, “What is this thing that you are doing? Will you rebel against the king?”",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> So I answered them, and said to them, “The God of heaven Himself will prosper us; therefore we His servants will arise and build, but you have no heritage or right or memorial in Jerusalem.”"

			"1": "<sup>1</sup> But it so happened, when Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, that he was furious and very indignant, and mocked the Jews.",
			"2": "<sup>2</sup> And he spoke before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, “What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they fortify themselves? Will they offer sacrifices? Will they complete it in a day? Will they revive the stones from the heaps of rubbish—stones that are burned?”",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> Now Tobiah the Ammonite was beside him, and he said, “Whatever they build, if even a fox goes up on  it, he will break down their stone wall.”",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> Hear, O our God, for we are despised; turn their reproach on their own heads, and give them as plunder to a land of captivity!",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> Do not cover their iniquity, and do not let their sin be blotted out from before You; for they have provoked You to anger before the builders.",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> So we built the wall, and the entire wall was joined together up to half its height, for the people had a mind to work.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> Now it happened, when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the walls of Jerusalem were being restored and the gaps were beginning to be closed, that they became very angry,",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> and all of them conspired together to come and attack Jerusalem and create confusion.",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> Nevertheless we made our prayer to our God, and because of them we set a watch against them day and night.",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> Then Judah said, “The strength of the laborers is failing, and there  is so much rubbish that we are not able to build the wall.”",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> And our adversaries said, “They will neither know nor see anything, till we come into their midst and kill them and cause the work to cease.”",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> So it was, when the Jews who dwelt near them came, that they told us ten times, “From whatever place you turn, they  will  be upon us.”",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> Therefore I positioned men behind the lower parts of the wall, at the openings; and I set the people according to their families, with their swords, their spears, and their bows.",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> And I looked, and arose and said to the nobles, to the leaders, and to the rest of the people, “Do not be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, great and awesome, and fight for your brethren, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your houses.”",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> And it happened, when our enemies heard that it was known to us, and that God had brought their plot to nothing, that all of us returned to the wall, everyone to his work.",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> So it was, from that time on, that half of my servants worked at construction, while the other half held the spears, the shields, the bows, and wore armor; and the leaders were behind all the house of Judah.",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> Those who built on the wall, and those who carried burdens, loaded themselves so that with one hand they worked at construction, and with the other held a weapon.",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> Every one of the builders had his sword girded at his side as he built. And the one who sounded the trumpet was beside me.",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> Then I said to the nobles, the rulers, and the rest of the people, “The work is great and extensive, and we are separated far from one another on the wall.",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, rally to us there. Our God will fight for us.”",
			"21": "<sup>21</sup> So we labored in the work, and half of the  men held the spears from daybreak until the stars appeared.",
			"22": "<sup>22</sup> At the same time I also said to the people, “Let each man and his servant stay at night in Jerusalem, that they may be our guard by night and a working party by day.”",
			"23": "<sup>23</sup> So neither I, my brethren, my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me took off our clothes, except that everyone took them off for washing."

			"1": "<sup>1</sup> And there was a great outcry of the people and their wives against their Jewish brethren.",
			"2": "<sup>2</sup> For there were those who said, “We, our sons, and our daughters are many; therefore let us get grain, that we may eat and live.”",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> There were also some who said, “We have mortgaged our lands and vineyards and houses, that we might buy grain because of the famine.”",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> There were also those who said, “We have borrowed money for the king’s tax on our lands and vineyards.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children; and indeed we are forcing our sons and our daughters to be slaves, and some of our daughters have been brought into slavery. It  is not in our power to  redeem  them, for other men have our lands and vineyards.”",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> And I became very angry when I heard their outcry and these words.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> After serious thought, I rebuked the nobles and rulers, and said to them, “Each of you is exacting usury from his brother.” So I called a great assembly against them.",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> And I said to them, “According to our ability we have redeemed our Jewish brethren who were sold to the nations. Now indeed, will you even sell your brethren? Or should they be sold to us?” Then they were silenced and found nothing to  say.",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> Then I said, “What you are doing is not good. Should you not walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the nations, our enemies?",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> I also, with my brethren and my servants, am lending them money and grain. Please, let us stop this usury!",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> Restore now to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their olive groves, and their houses, also a hundredth of the money and the grain, the new wine and the oil, that you have charged them.”",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> So they said, “We will restore it, and will require nothing from them; we will do as you say.” Then I called the priests, and required an oath from them that they would do according to this promise.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> Then I shook out the fold of my garment and said, “So may God shake out each man from his house, and from his property, who does not perform this promise. Even thus may he be shaken out and emptied.” And all the assembly said, “Amen!” and praised the Lord. Then the people did according to this promise.",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> Moreover, from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year until the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes, twelve years, neither I nor my brothers ate the governor’s provisions.",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> But the former governors who were before me laid burdens on the people, and took from them bread and wine, besides forty shekels of silver. Yes, even their servants bore rule over the people, but I did not do so, because of the fear of God.",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> Indeed, I also continued the work on this wall, and we did not buy any land. All my servants were gathered there for the work.",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> And at my table were one hundred and fifty Jews and rulers, besides those who came to us from the nations around us.",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> Now that  which was prepared daily was one ox and six choice sheep. Also fowl were prepared for me, and once every ten days an abundance of all kinds of wine. Yet in spite of this I did not demand the governor’s provisions, because the bondage was heavy on this people.",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> Remember me, my God, for good, according  to all that I have done for this people."

			"1": "<sup>1</sup> Now it happened when Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and the rest of our enemies heard that I had rebuilt the wall, and that there were no breaks left in it (though at that time I had not hung the doors in the gates),",
			"2": "<sup>2</sup> that Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, “Come, let us meet together among the villages in the plain of Ono.” But they thought to do me harm.",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> So I sent messengers to them, saying, “I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down. Why should the work cease while I leave it and go down to you?”",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> But they sent me this message four times, and I answered them in the same manner.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> Then Sanballat sent his servant to me as before, the fifth time, with an open letter in his hand.",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> In it was written: It is reported among the nations, and Geshem says, that you and the Jews plan to rebel; therefore, according to these rumors, you are rebuilding the wall, that you may be their king.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> And you have also appointed prophets to proclaim concerning you at Jerusalem, saying, “There  is a king in Judah!” Now these matters will be reported to the king. So come, therefore, and let us consult together.",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> Then I sent to him, saying, “No such things as you say are being done, but you invent them in your own heart.”",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> For they all were  trying  to make us afraid, saying, “Their hands will be weakened in the work, and it will not be done.” Now therefore, O  God, strengthen my hands.",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> Afterward I came to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who was a secret informer; and he said, “Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us close the doors of the temple, for they are coming to kill you; indeed, at night they will come to kill you.”",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> And I said, “Should such a man as I flee? And who is  there such as I who would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in!”",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> Then I perceived that God had not sent him at all, but that he pronounced this prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> For this reason he was hired, that I should be afraid and act that way and sin, so that they might have cause for an evil report, that they might reproach me.",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> My God, remember Tobiah and Sanballat, according to these their works, and the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who would have made me afraid.",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day of Elul, in fifty-two days.",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> And it happened, when all our enemies heard of  it, and all the nations around us saw these  things, that they were very disheartened in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work was done by our God.",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> Also in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and the  letters  of Tobiah came to them.",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> For many in Judah were pledged to him, because he was the son-in-law of Shechaniah the son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> Also they reported his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. Tobiah sent letters to frighten me."

			"3": "<sup>3</sup> And I said to them, “Do not let the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot; and while they stand guard, let them shut and bar the doors; and appoint guards from among the inhabitants of Jerusalem, one at his watch station and another in front of his own house.”",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> Now the city was large and spacious, but the people in it were  few, and the houses were not rebuilt.",

			"33": "<sup>33</sup> and Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam,",
			"34": "<sup>34</sup> Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah,",
			"35": "<sup>35</sup> and some of the priests’ sons with trumpets—Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Michaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph,",
			"36": "<sup>36</sup> and his brethren, Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God. Ezra the scribe went before them.",
			"37": "<sup>37</sup> By the Fountain Gate, in front of them, they went up the stairs of the City of David, on the stairway of the wall, beyond the house of David, as far as the Water Gate eastward.",
			"38": "<sup>38</sup> The other thanksgiving choir went the opposite way, and I was behind them with half of the people on the wall, going past the Tower of the Ovens as far as the Broad Wall,",
			"39": "<sup>39</sup> and above the Gate of Ephraim, above the Old Gate, above the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel, the Tower of the Hundred, as far as the Sheep Gate; and they stopped by the Gate of the Prison.",
			"40": "<sup>40</sup> So the two thanksgiving choirs stood in the house of God, likewise I and the half of the rulers with me;",
			"41": "<sup>41</sup> and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Minjamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;",
			"42": "<sup>42</sup> also Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer. The singers sang loudly with Jezrahiah the director.",
			"43": "<sup>43</sup> Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced, for God had made them rejoice with great joy; the women and the children also rejoiced, so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard afar off.",
			"44": "<sup>44</sup> And at the same time some were appointed over the rooms of the storehouse for the offerings, the firstfruits, and the tithes, to gather into them from the fields of the cities the portions specified by the Law for the priests and Levites; for Judah rejoiced over the priests and Levites who ministered.",
			"45": "<sup>45</sup> Both the singers and the gatekeepers kept the charge of their God and the charge of the purification, according to the command of David and Solomon his son.",
			"46": "<sup>46</sup> For in the days of David and Asaph of old there  were chiefs of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving to God.",
			"47": "<sup>47</sup> In the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah all Israel gave the portions for the singers and the gatekeepers, a portion for each day. They also consecrated holy  things for the Levites, and the Levites consecrated them for the children of Aaron."

			"3": "<sup>3</sup> So it was, when they had heard the Law, that they separated all the mixed multitude from Israel.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> Now before this, Eliashib the priest, having authority over the storerooms of the house of our God, was allied with Tobiah.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> And he had prepared for him a large room, where previously they had stored the grain offerings, the frankincense, the articles, the tithes of grain, the new wine and oil, which were commanded to  be  given to the Levites and singers and gatekeepers, and the offerings for the priests.",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> But during all this I was not in Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I had returned to the king. Then after certain days I obtained leave from the king,",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> and I came to Jerusalem and discovered the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in preparing a room for him in the courts of the house of God.",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> And it grieved me bitterly; therefore I threw all the household goods of Tobiah out of the room.",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> Then I commanded them to cleanse the rooms; and I brought back into them the articles of the house of God, with the grain offering and the frankincense.",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> I also realized that the portions for the Levites had not been given them; for each of the Levites and the singers who did the work had gone back to his field.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> So I contended with the rulers, and said, “Why is the house of God forsaken?” And I gathered them together and set them in their place.",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> Then all Judah brought the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil to the storehouse.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> And I appointed as treasurers over the storehouse Shelemiah the priest and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah; and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were considered faithful, and their task was to distribute to their brethren.",

And I warned them about the day on which they were selling provisions.",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> Men of Tyre dwelt there also, who brought in fish and all kinds of goods, and sold them on the Sabbath to the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.",
