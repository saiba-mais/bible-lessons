			"1": "<sup>1</sup> Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our beloved friend and fellow laborer,",
			"2": "<sup>2</sup> to the beloved Apphia, Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> I thank my God, making mention of you always in my prayers,",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> hearing of your love and faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints,",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> that the sharing of your faith may become effective by the acknowledgment of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> For we have great joy and consolation in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed by you, brother.",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> Therefore, though I might be very bold in Christ to command you what is fitting,",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> yet for love’s sake I rather appeal to  you—being such a one as Paul, the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ—",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten while in my chains,",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> who once was unprofitable to you, but now is profitable to you and to me.",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> I am sending him back. You therefore receive him, that is, my own heart,",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> whom I wished to keep with me, that on your behalf he might minister to me in my chains for the gospel.",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> But without your consent I wanted to do nothing, that your good deed might not be by compulsion, as it were, but voluntary.",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> For perhaps he departed for a while for this purpose, that you might receive him forever,",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> no longer as a slave but more than a slave—a beloved brother, especially to me but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> If then you count me as a partner, receive him as you  would me.",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> But if he has wronged you or owes anything, put that on my account.",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> I, Paul, am writing with my own hand. I will repay—not to mention to you that you owe me even your own self besides.",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in the Lord.",
			"21": "<sup>21</sup> Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say.",
			"22": "<sup>22</sup> But, meanwhile, also prepare a guest room for me, for I trust that through your prayers I shall be granted to you.",
			"23": "<sup>23</sup> Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,",
			"24": "<sup>24</sup> as  do  Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow laborers.",
			"25": "<sup>25</sup> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen."
