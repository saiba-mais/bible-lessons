			"1": "<sup>1</sup> Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David had returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had stayed two days in Ziklag,",
			"2": "<sup>2</sup> on the third day, behold, it happened that a man came from Saul’s camp with his clothes torn and dust on his head. So it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the ground and prostrated himself.",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> And David said to him, “Where have you come from?” So he said to him, “I have escaped from the camp of Israel.”",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> Then David said to him, “How did the matter go? Please tell me.” And he answered, “The people have fled from the battle, many of the people are fallen and dead, and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.”",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> So David said to the young man who told him, “How do you know that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?”",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> Then the young man who told him said, “As I happened by chance to  be on Mount Gilboa, there was Saul, leaning on his spear; and indeed the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> Now when he looked behind him, he saw me and called to me. And I answered, ‘Here I am.’",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> And he said to me, ‘Who are you?’ So I answered him, ‘I am an Amalekite.’",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> He said to me again, ‘Please stand over me and kill me, for anguish has come upon me, but my life still remains in me.’",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> So I stood over him and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after he had fallen. And I took the crown that was on his head and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord.”",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> Therefore David took hold of his own clothes and tore them, and so  did all the men who were with him.",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> And they mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and for Jonathan his son, for the people of the Lord and for the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> Then David said to the young man who told him, “Where are you from?” And he answered, “I am the son of an alien, an Amalekite.”",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> So David said to him, “How was it you were not afraid to put forth your hand to destroy the Lord’s anointed?”",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> Then David called one of the young men and said, “Go near, and execute him!” And he struck him so that he died.",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> So David said to him, “Your blood is on your own head, for your own mouth has testified against you, saying, ‘I have killed the Lord’s anointed.’ ”",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> Then David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son,",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> and he told them to teach the children of Judah the  Song  of the Bow; indeed it  is written in the Book of Jasher:",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> “The beauty of Israel is slain on your high places! How the mighty have fallen!",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> Tell it not in Gath, Proclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon— Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.",
			"21": "<sup>21</sup> “O mountains of Gilboa, Let  there  be no dew nor rain upon you, Nor fields of offerings. For the shield of the mighty is cast away there! The shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.",
			"22": "<sup>22</sup> From the blood of the slain, From the fat of the mighty, The bow of Jonathan did not turn back, And the sword of Saul did not return empty.",
			"23": "<sup>23</sup> “Saul and Jonathan were beloved and pleasant in their lives, And in their death they were not divided; They were swifter than eagles, They were stronger than lions.",
			"24": "<sup>24</sup> “O daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, Who clothed you in scarlet, with luxury; Who put ornaments of gold on your apparel.",
			"25": "<sup>25</sup> “How the mighty have fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan was slain in your high places.",
			"26": "<sup>26</sup> I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan; You have been very pleasant to me; Your love to me was wonderful, Surpassing the love of women.",
			"27": "<sup>27</sup> “How the mighty have fallen, And the weapons of war perished!”"

			"1": "<sup>1</sup> It happened after this that David inquired of the Lord, saying, “Shall I go up to any of the cities of Judah?” And the Lord said to him, “Go up.” David said, “Where shall I go up?” And He said, “To Hebron.”",
			"2": "<sup>2</sup> So David went up there, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite.",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> And David brought up the men who were with him, every man with his household. So they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> Then the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, “The men of Jabesh Gilead were  the  ones who buried Saul.”",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> So David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead, and said to them, “You are blessed of the Lord, for you have shown this kindness to your lord, to Saul, and have buried him.",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> And now may the Lord show kindness and truth to you. I also will repay you this kindness, because you have done this thing.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> Now therefore, let your hands be strengthened, and be valiant; for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah has anointed me king over them.”",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> But Abner the son of Ner, commander of Saul’s army, took Ishbosheth the son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim;",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> and he made him king over Gilead, over the Ashurites, over Jezreel, over Ephraim, over Benjamin, and over all Israel.",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. Only the house of Judah followed David.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> Now Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out and met them by the pool of Gibeon. So they sat down, one on one side of the pool and the other on the other side of the pool.",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> Then Abner said to Joab, “Let the young men now arise and compete before us.” And Joab said, “Let them arise.”",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> So they arose and went over by number, twelve from Benjamin, followers of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve from the servants of David.",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> And each one grasped his opponent by the head and thrust his sword in his opponent’s side; so they fell down together. Therefore that place was called the Field of Sharp Swords, which is in Gibeon.",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> So there was a very fierce battle that day, and Abner and the men of Israel were beaten before the servants of David.",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> Now the three sons of Zeruiah were there: Joab and Abishai and Asahel. And Asahel was  as fleet of foot as a wild gazelle.",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> So Asahel pursued Abner, and in going he did not turn to the right hand or to the left from following Abner.",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> Then Abner looked behind him and said, “Are you Asahel?” He answered, “I am.”",
			"21": "<sup>21</sup> And Abner said to him, “Turn aside to your right hand or to your left, and lay hold on one of the young men and take his armor for yourself.” But Asahel would not turn aside from following him.",
			"22": "<sup>22</sup> So Abner said again to Asahel, “Turn aside from following me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then could I face your brother Joab?”",
			"23": "<sup>23</sup> However, he refused to turn aside. Therefore Abner struck him in the stomach with the blunt end of the spear, so that the spear came out of his back; and he fell down there and died on the spot. So it was that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died, stood still.",
			"24": "<sup>24</sup> Joab and Abishai also pursued Abner. And the sun was going down when they came to the hill of Ammah, which is before Giah by the road to the Wilderness of Gibeon.",
			"25": "<sup>25</sup> Now the children of Benjamin gathered together behind Abner and became a unit, and took their stand on top of a hill.",
			"26": "<sup>26</sup> Then Abner called to Joab and said, “Shall the sword devour forever? Do you not know that it will be bitter in the latter end? How long will it be then until you tell the people to return from pursuing their brethren?”",
			"27": "<sup>27</sup> And Joab said, “As God lives, unless you had spoken, surely then by morning all the people would have given up pursuing their brethren.”",
			"28": "<sup>28</sup> So Joab blew a trumpet; and all the people stood still and did not pursue Israel anymore, nor did they fight anymore.",
			"29": "<sup>29</sup> Then Abner and his men went on all that night through the plain, crossed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron; and they came to Mahanaim.",
			"30": "<sup>30</sup> So Joab returned from pursuing Abner. And when he had gathered all the people together, there were missing of David’s servants nineteen men and Asahel.",
			"31": "<sup>31</sup> But the servants of David had struck down, of Benjamin and Abner’s men, three hundred and sixty men who died.",
			"32": "<sup>32</sup> Then they took up Asahel and buried him in his father’s tomb, which was  in  Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at daybreak."

			"1": "<sup>1</sup> Now there was a long war between the house of Saul and the house of David. But David grew stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker.",
			"2": "<sup>2</sup> Sons were born to David in Hebron: His firstborn was Amnon by Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> his second, Chileab, by Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite; the third, Absalom the son of Maacah, the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur;",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> and the sixth, Ithream, by David’s wife Eglah. These were born to David in Hebron.",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> Now it was so, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner was strengthening his  hold on the house of Saul.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> And Saul had a concubine, whose name was  Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. So Ishbosheth said to Abner, “Why have you gone in to my father’s concubine?”",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> Then Abner became very angry at the words of Ishbosheth, and said, “Am I a dog’s head that belongs to Judah? Today I show loyalty to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hand of David; and you charge me today with a fault concerning this woman?",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> May God do so to Abner, and more also, if I do not do for David as the Lord has sworn to him—",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan to Beersheba.”",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> And he could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> Then Abner sent messengers on his behalf to David, saying, “Whose is the land?” saying also, “Make your covenant with me, and indeed my hand shall  be with you to bring all Israel to you.”",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> And David said, “Good, I will make a covenant with you. But one thing I require of you: you shall not see my face unless you first bring Michal, Saul’s daughter, when you come to see my face.”",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> So David sent messengers to Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, saying, “Give me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to myself for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.”",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> And Ishbosheth sent and took her from her husband, from Paltiel the son of Laish.",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> Then her husband went along with her to Bahurim, weeping behind her. So Abner said to him, “Go, return!” And he returned.",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> Now Abner had communicated with the elders of Israel, saying, “In time past you were seeking for David to  be king over you.",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> Now then, do it!  For the Lord has spoken of David, saying, ‘By the hand of My servant David, I will save My people Israel from the hand of the Philistines and the hand of all their enemies.’ ”",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> And Abner also spoke in the hearing of Benjamin. Then Abner also went to speak in the hearing of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel and the whole house of Benjamin.",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> So Abner and twenty men with him came to David at Hebron. And David made a feast for Abner and the men who were with him.",
			"21": "<sup>21</sup> Then Abner said to David, “I will arise and go, and gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may reign over all that your heart desires.” So David sent Abner away, and he went in peace.",
			"22": "<sup>22</sup> At that moment the servants of David and Joab came from a raid and brought much spoil with them. But Abner was not with David in Hebron, for he had sent him away, and he had gone in peace.",
			"23": "<sup>23</sup> When Joab and all the troops that were with him had come, they told Joab, saying, “Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he sent him away, and he has gone in peace.”",
			"24": "<sup>24</sup> Then Joab came to the king and said, “What have you done? Look, Abner came to you; why is it that you sent him away, and he has already gone?",
			"25": "<sup>25</sup> Surely you realize that Abner the son of Ner came to deceive you, to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you are doing.”",
			"26": "<sup>26</sup> And when Joab had gone from David’s presence, he sent messengers after Abner, who brought him back from the well of Sirah. But David did not know it.",
			"27": "<sup>27</sup> Now when Abner had returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him privately, and there stabbed him in the stomach, so that he died for the blood of Asahel his brother.",
			"28": "<sup>28</sup> Afterward, when David heard it, he said, “My kingdom and I are guiltless before the Lord forever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner.",
			"29": "<sup>29</sup> Let it rest on the head of Joab and on all his father’s house; and let there never fail to be in the house of Joab one who has a discharge or is a leper, who leans on a staff or falls by the sword, or who lacks bread.”",
			"30": "<sup>30</sup> So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.",
			"31": "<sup>31</sup> Then David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him, “Tear your clothes, gird yourselves with sackcloth, and mourn for Abner.” And King David followed the coffin.",
			"32": "<sup>32</sup> So they buried Abner in Hebron; and the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept.",
			"33": "<sup>33</sup> And the king sang a  lament over Abner and said: “Should Abner die as a fool dies?",
			"34": "<sup>34</sup> Your hands were not bound Nor your feet put into fetters; As a man falls before wicked men, so you fell.” Then all the people wept over him again.",
			"35": "<sup>35</sup> And when all the people came to persuade David to eat food while it was still day, David took an oath, saying, “God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread or anything else till the sun goes down!”",
			"36": "<sup>36</sup> Now all the people took note of  it, and it pleased them, since whatever the king did pleased all the people.",
			"37": "<sup>37</sup> For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it had not been the king’s intent to kill Abner the son of Ner.",
			"38": "<sup>38</sup> Then the king said to his servants, “Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel?",
			"39": "<sup>39</sup> And I am weak today, though anointed king; and these men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too harsh for me. The Lord shall repay the evildoer according to his wickedness.”"

			"1": "<sup>1</sup> When Saul’s son heard that Abner had died in Hebron, he lost heart, and all Israel was troubled.",
			"2": "<sup>2</sup> Now Saul’s son had two men who  were captains of troops. The name of one was Baanah and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin. (For Beeroth also was part of Benjamin,",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> because the Beerothites fled to Gittaim and have been sojourners there until this day.)",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> Jonathan, Saul’s son, had a son who  was lame in his feet. He was five years old when the news about Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel; and his nurse took him up and fled. And it happened, as she made haste to flee, that he fell and became lame. His name was  Mephibosheth.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> Then the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, set out and came at about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who was lying on his bed at noon.",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> And they came there, all the way into the house, as  though to get wheat, and they stabbed him in the stomach. Then Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> For when they came into the house, he was lying on his bed in his bedroom; then they struck him and killed him, beheaded him and took his head, and were all night escaping through the plain.",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> And they brought the head of Ishbosheth to David at Hebron, and said to the king, “Here is the head of Ishbosheth, the son of Saul your enemy, who sought your life; and the Lord has avenged my lord the king this day of Saul and his descendants.”",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> But David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, “As the Lord lives, who has redeemed my life from all adversity,",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> when someone told me, saying, ‘Look, Saul is dead,’ thinking to have brought good news, I arrested him and had him executed in Ziklag—the one who thought I would give him a reward for his news.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> How much more, when wicked men have killed a righteous person in his own house on his bed? Therefore, shall I not now require his blood at your hand and remove you from the earth?”",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> So David commanded his young men, and they executed them, cut off their hands and feet, and hanged them by the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth and buried it in the tomb of Abner in Hebron."

			"1": "<sup>1</sup> Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and spoke, saying, “Indeed we are your bone and your flesh.",
			"2": "<sup>2</sup> Also, in time past, when Saul was king over us, you were the one who led Israel out and brought them in; and the Lord said to you, ‘You shall shepherd My people Israel, and be ruler over Israel.’ ”",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> Therefore all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and King David made a covenant with them at Hebron before the Lord. And they anointed David king over Israel.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> David was  thirty years old when he began to reign, and  he reigned forty years.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spoke to David, saying, “You shall not come in here; but the blind and the lame will repel you,” thinking, “David cannot come in here.”",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion (that is, the City of David).",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> Now David said on that day, “Whoever climbs up by way of the water shaft and defeats the Jebusites (the lame and the blind, who  are hated by David’s soul), he  shall  be  chief  and  captain.” Therefore they say, “The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.”",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> Then David dwelt in the stronghold, and called it the City of David. And David built all around from the Millo and inward.",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> So David went on and became great, and the Lord God of hosts was with him.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> Then Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters and masons. And they built David a house.",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> So David knew that the Lord had established him as king over Israel, and that He had exalted His kingdom for the sake of His people Israel.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> And David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem, after he had come from Hebron. Also more sons and daughters were born to David.",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> Now these are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia,",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.",

			"18": "<sup>18</sup> The Philistines also went and deployed themselves in the Valley of Rephaim.",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> So David inquired of the Lord, saying, “Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will You deliver them into my hand?” And the Lord said to David, “Go up, for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into your hand.”",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> So David went to Baal Perazim, and David defeated them there; and he said, “The Lord has broken through my enemies before me, like a breakthrough of water.” Therefore he called the name of that place Baal Perazim.",
			"21": "<sup>21</sup> And they left their images there, and David and his men carried them away.",
			"22": "<sup>22</sup> Then the Philistines went up once again and deployed themselves in the Valley of Rephaim.",
			"23": "<sup>23</sup> Therefore David inquired of the Lord, and He said, “You shall not go up; circle around behind them, and come upon them in front of the mulberry trees.",
			"24": "<sup>24</sup> And it shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, then you shall advance quickly. For then the Lord will go out before you to strike the camp of the Philistines.”",

			"3": "<sup>3</sup> So they set the ark of God on a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill; and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill, accompanying the ark of God; and Ahio went before the ark.",

			"15": "<sup>15</sup> So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the Lord with shouting and with the sound of the trumpet.",

			"17": "<sup>17</sup> So they brought the ark of the Lord, and set it in its place in the midst of the tabernacle that David had erected for it. Then David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the Lord.",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> And when David had finished offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the Lord of hosts.",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> Then he distributed among all the people, among the whole multitude of Israel, both the women and the men, to everyone a loaf of bread, a piece of  meat, and a cake of raisins. So all the people departed, everyone to his house.",

			"14": "<sup>14</sup> For we will surely die and become like water spilled on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again. Yet God does not take away a life; but He devises means, so that His banished ones are not expelled from Him.",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> Now therefore, I have come to speak of this thing to my lord the king because the people have made me afraid. And your maidservant said, ‘I will now speak to the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his maidservant.",

			"2": "<sup>2</sup> So the king said to Joab the commander of the army who was with him, “Now go throughout all the tribes of Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, and count the people, that I may know the number of the people.”",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> And Joab said to the king, “Now may the Lord your God add to the people a hundred times more than there are, and may the eyes of my lord the king see it. But why does my lord the king desire this thing?”",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab and against the captains of the army. Therefore Joab and the captains of the army went out from the presence of the king to count the people of Israel.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> And they crossed over the Jordan and camped in Aroer, on the right side of the town which is in the midst of the ravine of Gad, and toward Jazer.",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> Then they came to Gilead and to the land of Tahtim Hodshi; they came to Dan Jaan and around to Sidon;",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> and they came to the stronghold of Tyre and to all the cities of the Hivites and the Canaanites. Then they went out to South Judah as  far  as Beersheba.",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> Then Joab gave the sum of the number of the people to the king. And there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword, and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.",

			"11": "<sup>11</sup> Now when David arose in the morning, the word of the Lord came to the prophet Gad, David’s seer, saying,",

Now consider and see what answer I should take back to Him who sent me.”",
