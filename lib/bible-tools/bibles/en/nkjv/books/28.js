			"2": "<sup>2</sup> When the Lord began to speak by Hosea, the Lord said to Hosea: “Go, take yourself a wife of harlotry And children of harlotry, For the land has committed great harlotry By  departing from the Lord.”",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> Then the Lord said to him: “Call his name Jezreel, For in a little while I will avenge the bloodshed of Jezreel on the house of Jehu, And bring an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> It shall come to pass in that day That I will break the bow of Israel in the Valley of Jezreel.”",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> And she conceived again and bore a daughter. Then God said to him: “Call her name Lo-Ruhamah, For I will no longer have mercy on the house of Israel, But I will utterly take them away.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> Yet I will have mercy on the house of Judah, Will save them by the Lord their God, And will not save them by bow, Nor by sword or battle, By horses or horsemen.”",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> Now when she had weaned Lo-Ruhamah, she conceived and bore a son.",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> Then God said: “Call his name Lo-Ammi, For you are not My people, And I will not be your God.",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> “Yet the number of the children of Israel Shall be as the sand of the sea, Which cannot be measured or numbered. And it shall come to pass In the place where it was said to them, ‘You are not My people,’ There it shall be said to them, ‘You  are  sons of the living God.’",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> Then the children of Judah and the children of Israel Shall be gathered together, And appoint for themselves one head; And they shall come up out of the land, For great will  be the day of Jezreel!"

			"3": "<sup>3</sup> Lest I strip her naked And expose her, as in the day she was born, And make her like a wilderness, And set her like a dry land, And slay her with thirst.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> “I will not have mercy on her children, For they are the children of harlotry.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> For their mother has played the harlot; She who conceived them has behaved shamefully. For she said, ‘I will go after my lovers, Who give me my bread and my water, My wool and my linen, My oil and my drink.’",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> “Therefore, behold, I will hedge up your way with thorns, And wall her in, So that she cannot find her paths.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> She will chase her lovers, But not overtake them; Yes, she will seek them, but not find them. Then she will say, ‘I will go and return to my first husband, For then it  was better for me than now.’",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> For she did not know That I gave her grain, new wine, and oil, And multiplied her silver and gold— Which they prepared for Baal.",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> “Therefore I will return and take away My grain in its time And My new wine in its season, And will take back My wool and My linen, Given to cover her nakedness.",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> Now I will uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, And no one shall deliver her from My hand.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> I will also cause all her mirth to cease, Her feast days, Her New Moons, Her Sabbaths— All her appointed feasts.",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> “And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, Of which she has said, ‘These are my wages that my lovers have given me.’ So I will make them a forest, And the beasts of the field shall eat them.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> I will punish her For the days of the Baals to which she burned incense. She decked herself with her earrings and jewelry, And went after her lovers; But Me she forgot,” says the Lord.",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> “Therefore, behold, I will allure her, Will bring her into the wilderness, And speak comfort to her.",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> I will give her her vineyards from there, And the Valley of Achor as a door of hope; She shall sing there, As in the days of her youth, As in the day when she came up from the land of Egypt.",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> “And it shall be, in that day,” Says the Lord, “That you will call Me ‘My Husband,’ And no longer call Me ‘My Master,’",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> For I will take from her mouth the names of the Baals, And they shall be remembered by their name no more.",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> In that day I will make a covenant for them With the beasts of the field, With the birds of the air, And with the creeping things of the ground. Bow and sword of battle I will shatter from the earth, To make them lie down safely.",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> “I will betroth you to Me forever; Yes, I will betroth you to Me In righteousness and justice, In lovingkindness and mercy;",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> I will betroth you to Me in faithfulness, And you shall know the Lord.",
			"21": "<sup>21</sup> “It shall come to pass in that day That  I will answer,” says the Lord; “I will answer the heavens, And they shall answer the earth.",
			"22": "<sup>22</sup> The earth shall answer With grain, With new wine, And with oil; They shall answer Jezreel.",
			"23": "<sup>23</sup> Then I will sow her for Myself in the earth, And I will have mercy on her  who  had not obtained mercy; Then I will say to those  who  were not My people, ‘You are My people!’ And they shall say, ‘You are my God!’ ”"

			"2": "<sup>2</sup> So I bought her for myself for fifteen shekels of silver, and one and one-half homers of barley.",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> And I said to her, “You shall stay with me many days; you shall not play the harlot, nor shall you have a man—so, too, will I be toward you.”",

			"13": "<sup>13</sup> They offer sacrifices on the mountaintops, And burn incense on the hills, Under oaks, poplars, and terebinths, Because their shade is good. Therefore your daughters commit harlotry, And your brides commit adultery.",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> “I will not punish your daughters when they commit harlotry, Nor your brides when they commit adultery; For the  men themselves go apart with harlots, And offer sacrifices with a ritual harlot. Therefore people who do not understand will be trampled.",
