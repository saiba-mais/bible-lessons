			"1": "<sup>1</sup> Paul, called to  be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,",
			"2": "<sup>2</sup> To the church of God which is at Corinth, to those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to  be saints, with all who in every place call on the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> I thank my God always concerning you for the grace of God which was given to you by Christ Jesus,",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> that you were enriched in everything by Him in all utterance and all knowledge,",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you,",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> so that you come short in no gift, eagerly waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ,",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> who will also confirm you to the end, that  you  may  be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> God is faithful, by whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> Now I plead with you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> For it has been declared to me concerning you, my brethren, by those of Chloe’s household, that there are contentions among you.",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> Now I say this, that each of you says, “I am of Paul,” or “I am of Apollos,” or “I am of Cephas,” or “I am of Christ.”",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> lest anyone should say that I had baptized in my own name.",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> Yes, I also baptized the household of Stephanas. Besides, I do not know whether I baptized any other.",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel, not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of no effect.",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> For it is written: “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, And bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.”",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?",
			"21": "<sup>21</sup> For since, in the wisdom of God, the world through wisdom did not know God, it pleased God through the foolishness of the message preached to save those who believe.",
			"22": "<sup>22</sup> For Jews request a sign, and Greeks seek after wisdom;",
			"23": "<sup>23</sup> but we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling block and to the Greeks foolishness,",
			"24": "<sup>24</sup> but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.",
			"25": "<sup>25</sup> Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.",
			"26": "<sup>26</sup> For you see your calling, brethren, that not many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are  called.",
			"27": "<sup>27</sup> But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to put to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to put to shame the things which are mighty;",
			"28": "<sup>28</sup> and the base things of the world and the things which are despised God has chosen, and the things which are not, to bring to nothing the things that are,",
			"29": "<sup>29</sup> that no flesh should glory in His presence.",
			"30": "<sup>30</sup> But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God—and righteousness and sanctification and redemption—",
			"31": "<sup>31</sup> that, as it is written, “He who glories, let him glory in the Lord.”"
		},
		"2": {
			"1": "<sup>1</sup> And I, brethren, when I came to you, did not come with excellence of speech or of wisdom declaring to you the testimony of God.",
			"2": "<sup>2</sup> For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> I was with you in weakness, in fear, and in much trembling.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> And my speech and my preaching were not with persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> that your faith should not be in the wisdom of men but in the power of God.",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> However, we speak wisdom among those who are mature, yet not the wisdom of this age, nor of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the ages for our glory,",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> which none of the rulers of this age knew; for had they known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> But as it is written: “Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, Nor have entered into the heart of man The things which God has prepared for those who love Him.”",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> But God has revealed them to us through His Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> For what man knows the things of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God.",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might know the things that have been freely given to us by God.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> These things we also speak, not in words which man’s wisdom teaches but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> But he who is spiritual judges all things, yet he himself is rightly judged by no one.",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> For “who has known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct Him?” But we have the mind of Christ."
		},
		"3": {
			"1": "<sup>1</sup> And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual people but as to carnal, as to babes in Christ.",
			"2": "<sup>2</sup> I fed you with milk and not with solid food; for until now you were not able to  receive  it, and even now you are still not able;",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> for you are still carnal. For where there  are envy, strife, and divisions among you, are you not carnal and behaving like mere men?",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> For when one says, “I am of Paul,” and another, “I am of Apollos,” are you not carnal?",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers through whom you believed, as the Lord gave to each one?",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase.",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> Now he who plants and he who waters are one, and each one will receive his own reward according to his own labor.",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s field, you  are  God’s building.",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation, and another builds on it. But let each one take heed how he builds on it.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> For no other foundation can anyone lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> Now if anyone builds on this foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw,",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> each one’s work will become clear; for the Day will declare it, because it will be revealed by fire; and the fire will test each one’s work, of what sort it is.",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> If anyone’s work which he has built on it endures, he will receive a reward.",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> If anyone’s work is burned, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> Do you not know that you are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> If anyone defiles the temple of God, God will destroy him. For the temple of God is holy, which temple you are.",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you seems to be wise in this age, let him become a fool that he may become wise.",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, “He catches the wise in their own craftiness”;",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> and again, “The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are futile.”",
			"21": "<sup>21</sup> Therefore let no one boast in men. For all things are yours:",
			"22": "<sup>22</sup> whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas, or the world or life or death, or things present or things to come—all are yours.",
			"23": "<sup>23</sup> And you are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s."
		},
		"4": {
			"1": "<sup>1</sup> Let a man so consider us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.",
			"2": "<sup>2</sup> Moreover it is required in stewards that one be found faithful.",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by a human court. In fact, I do not even judge myself.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> For I know of nothing against myself, yet I am not justified by this; but He who judges me is the Lord.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness and reveal the counsels of the hearts. Then each one’s praise will come from God.",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> Now these things, brethren, I have figuratively transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes, that you may learn in us not to think beyond what is written, that none of you may be puffed up on behalf of one against the other.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> For who makes you differ from  another? And what do you have that you did not receive? Now if you did indeed receive it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> You are already full! You are already rich! You have reigned as kings without us—and indeed I could wish you did reign, that we also might reign with you!",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> For I think that God has displayed us, the apostles, last, as men condemned to death; for we have been made a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men.",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> We are  fools for Christ’s sake, but you are wise in Christ! We are weak, but you are strong! You are distinguished, but we are dishonored!",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> To the present hour we both hunger and thirst, and we are poorly clothed, and beaten, and homeless.",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> And we labor, working with our own hands. Being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we endure;",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> being defamed, we entreat. We have been made as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all things until now.",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> I do not write these things to shame you, but as my beloved children I warn you.",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> For though you might have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet you  do not have many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> Therefore I urge you, imitate me.",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> For this reason I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful son in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways in Christ, as I teach everywhere in every church.",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> Now some are puffed up, as though I were not coming to you.",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord wills, and I will know, not the word of those who are puffed up, but the power.",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> For the kingdom of God is not in word but in power.",
			"21": "<sup>21</sup> What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?"
		},
		"5": {
			"1": "<sup>1</sup> It is actually reported that  there  is sexual immorality among you, and such sexual immorality as is not even named among the Gentiles—that a man has his father’s wife!",
			"2": "<sup>2</sup> And you are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he who has done this deed might be taken away from among you.",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> For I indeed, as absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged (as though I were present) him who has so done this deed.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together, along with my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> Your glorying is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> Therefore purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, since you truly are unleavened. For indeed Christ, our Passover, was sacrificed for us.",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> I wrote to you in my epistle not to keep company with sexually immoral people.",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> Yet I certainly did not mean with the sexually immoral people of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or idolaters, since then you would need to go out of the world.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> But now I have written to you not to keep company with anyone named a brother, who is sexually immoral, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner—not even to eat with such a person.",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> For what have I to  do with judging those also who are outside? Do you not judge those who are inside?",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> But those who are outside God judges. Therefore “put away from yourselves the evil person.”"
		},
		"6": {
			"1": "<sup>1</sup> Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?",
			"2": "<sup>2</sup> Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world will be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> Do you not know that we shall judge angels? How much more, things that pertain to this life?",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> If then you have judgments concerning things pertaining to this life, do you appoint those who are least esteemed by the church to judge?",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> I say this to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you, not even one, who will be able to judge between his brethren?",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> But brother goes to law against brother, and that before unbelievers!",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> Now therefore, it is already an utter failure for you that you go to law against one another. Why do you not rather accept wrong? Why do you not rather let  yourselves be cheated?",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> No, you yourselves do wrong and cheat, and you  do these things to  your brethren!",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites,",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> And such were some of you. But you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God.",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> All things are lawful for me, but all things are not helpful. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> Foods for the stomach and the stomach for foods, but God will destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for sexual immorality but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> And God both raised up the Lord and will also raise us up by His power.",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a harlot? Certainly not!",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> Or do you not know that he who is joined to a harlot is one body with  her? For “the two,” He says, “shall become one flesh.”",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit with  Him.",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> Flee sexual immorality. Every sin that a man does is outside the body, but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body.",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who  is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> For you were bought at a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God’s."
		},
		"7": {
			"1": "<sup>1</sup> Now concerning the things of which you wrote to me: It  is good for a man not to touch a woman.",
			"2": "<sup>2</sup> Nevertheless, because of sexual immorality, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> Let the husband render to his wife the affection due her, and likewise also the wife to her husband.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. And likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> Do not deprive one another except with consent for a time, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again so that Satan does not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> But I say this as a concession, not as a commandment.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> For I wish that all men were even as I myself. But each one has his own gift from God, one in this manner and another in that.",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> But I say to the unmarried and to the widows: It is good for them if they remain even as I am;",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> but if they cannot exercise self-control, let them marry. For it is better to marry than to burn with  passion.",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> Now to the married I command, yet not I but the Lord: A wife is not to depart from her husband.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> But even if she does depart, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband. And a husband is not to divorce his wife.",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> But to the rest I, not the Lord, say: If any brother has a wife who does not believe, and she is willing to live with him, let him not divorce her.",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> And a woman who has a husband who does not believe, if he is willing to live with her, let her not divorce him.",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband; otherwise your children would be unclean, but now they are holy.",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> But if the unbeliever departs, let him depart; a brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases. But God has called us to peace.",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> For how do you know, O wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save your wife?",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> But as God has distributed to each one, as the Lord has called each one, so let him walk. And so I ordain in all the churches.",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> Was anyone called while circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Was anyone called while uncircumcised? Let him not be circumcised.",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing, but keeping the commandments of God is  what  matters.",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> Let each one remain in the same calling in which he was called.",
			"21": "<sup>21</sup> Were you called while a slave? Do not be concerned about it; but if you can be made free, rather use it.",
			"22": "<sup>22</sup> For he who is called in the Lord while a slave is the Lord’s freedman. Likewise he who is called while free is Christ’s slave.",
			"23": "<sup>23</sup> You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of men.",
			"24": "<sup>24</sup> Brethren, let each one remain with God in that state in which he was called.",
			"25": "<sup>25</sup> Now concerning virgins: I have no commandment from the Lord; yet I give judgment as one whom the Lord in His mercy has made trustworthy.",
			"26": "<sup>26</sup> I suppose therefore that this is good because of the present distress—that it  is good for a man to remain as he is:",
			"27": "<sup>27</sup> Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be loosed. Are you loosed from a wife? Do not seek a wife.",
			"28": "<sup>28</sup> But even if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Nevertheless such will have trouble in the flesh, but I would spare you.",
			"29": "<sup>29</sup> But this I say, brethren, the time is short, so that from now on even those who have wives should be as though they had none,",
			"30": "<sup>30</sup> those who weep as though they did not weep, those who rejoice as though they did not rejoice, those who buy as though they did not possess,",
			"31": "<sup>31</sup> and those who use this world as not misusing it. For the form of this world is passing away.",
			"32": "<sup>32</sup> But I want you to be without care. He who is unmarried cares for the things of the Lord—how he may please the Lord.",
			"33": "<sup>33</sup> But he who is married cares about the things of the world—how he may please his wife.",
			"34": "<sup>34</sup> There is a difference between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she who is married cares about the things of the world—how she may please her husband.",
			"35": "<sup>35</sup> And this I say for your own profit, not that I may put a leash on you, but for what is proper, and that you may serve the Lord without distraction.",
			"36": "<sup>36</sup> But if any man thinks he is behaving improperly toward his virgin, if she is past the flower of youth, and thus it must be, let him do what he wishes. He does not sin; let them marry.",
			"37": "<sup>37</sup> Nevertheless he who stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has power over his own will, and has so determined in his heart that he will keep his virgin, does well.",
			"38": "<sup>38</sup> So then he who gives her in marriage does well, but he who does not give her in marriage does better.",
			"39": "<sup>39</sup> A wife is bound by law as long as her husband lives; but if her husband dies, she is at liberty to be married to whom she wishes, only in the Lord.",
			"40": "<sup>40</sup> But she is happier if she remains as she is, according to my judgment—and I think I also have the Spirit of God."

			"2": "<sup>2</sup> And if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he knows nothing yet as he ought to know.",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> But if anyone loves God, this one is known by Him.",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> Therefore concerning the eating of things offered to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there  is no other God but one.",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as there are many gods and many lords),",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> yet for us there  is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for Him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and through whom we live.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> However, there  is not in everyone that knowledge; for some, with consciousness of the idol, until now eat it as a thing offered to an idol; and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> But food does not commend us to God; for neither if we eat are we the better, nor if we do not eat are we the worse.",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> But beware lest somehow this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to those who are weak.",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> For if anyone sees you who have knowledge eating in an idol’s temple, will not the conscience of him who is weak be emboldened to eat those things offered to idols?",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> And because of your knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> But when you thus sin against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.",

			"8": "<sup>8</sup> Do I say these things as a mere man? Or does not the law say the same also?",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> For it is written in the law of Moses, “You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain.” Is it oxen God is concerned about?",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> Or does He say it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written, that he who plows should plow in hope, and he who threshes in hope should be partaker of his hope.",

			"14": "<sup>14</sup> Even so the Lord has commanded that those who preach the gospel should live from the gospel.",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> But I have used none of these things, nor have I written these things that it should be done so to me; for it would  be better for me to die than that anyone should make my boasting void.",

			"17": "<sup>17</sup> For if I do this willingly, I have a reward; but if against my will, I have been entrusted with a stewardship.",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> What is my reward then? That when I preach the gospel, I may present the gospel of Christ without charge, that I may not abuse my authority in the gospel.",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> For though I am free from all men,  I have made myself a servant to all, that I might win the more;",
