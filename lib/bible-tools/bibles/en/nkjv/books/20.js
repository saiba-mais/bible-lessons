			"2": "<sup>2</sup> To know wisdom and instruction, To perceive the words of understanding,",
			"3": "<sup>3</sup> To receive the instruction of wisdom, Justice, judgment, and equity;",
			"4": "<sup>4</sup> To give prudence to the simple, To the young man knowledge and discretion—",
			"5": "<sup>5</sup> A wise man will hear and increase learning, And a man of understanding will attain wise counsel,",
			"6": "<sup>6</sup> To understand a proverb and an enigma, The words of the wise and their riddles.",
			"7": "<sup>7</sup> The fear of the Lord  is the beginning of knowledge, But fools despise wisdom and instruction.",
			"8": "<sup>8</sup> My son, hear the instruction of your father, And do not forsake the law of your mother;",
			"9": "<sup>9</sup> For they will  be a graceful ornament on your head, And chains about your neck.",
			"10": "<sup>10</sup> My son, if sinners entice you, Do not consent.",
			"11": "<sup>11</sup> If they say, “Come with us, Let us lie in wait to shed blood; Let us lurk secretly for the innocent without cause;",
			"12": "<sup>12</sup> Let us swallow them alive like Sheol, And whole, like those who go down to the Pit;",
			"13": "<sup>13</sup> We shall find all kinds of precious possessions, We shall fill our houses with spoil;",
			"14": "<sup>14</sup> Cast in your lot among us, Let us all have one purse”—",
			"15": "<sup>15</sup> My son, do not walk in the way with them, Keep your foot from their path;",
			"16": "<sup>16</sup> For their feet run to evil, And they make haste to shed blood.",
			"17": "<sup>17</sup> Surely, in vain the net is spread In the sight of any bird;",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> But they lie in wait for their own blood, They lurk secretly for their own lives.",
			"19": "<sup>19</sup> So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain; It takes away the life of its owners.",
			"20": "<sup>20</sup> Wisdom calls aloud outside; She raises her voice in the open squares.",
			"21": "<sup>21</sup> She cries out in the chief concourses, At the openings of the gates in the city She speaks her words:",
			"22": "<sup>22</sup> “How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity? For scorners delight in their scorning, And fools hate knowledge.",
			"23": "<sup>23</sup> Turn at my rebuke; Surely I will pour out my spirit on you; I will make my words known to you.",
			"24": "<sup>24</sup> Because I have called and you refused, I have stretched out my hand and no one regarded,",
			"25": "<sup>25</sup> Because you disdained all my counsel, And would have none of my rebuke,",
			"26": "<sup>26</sup> I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your terror comes,",
			"27": "<sup>27</sup> When your terror comes like a storm, And your destruction comes like a whirlwind, When distress and anguish come upon you.",
			"28": "<sup>28</sup> “Then they will call on me, but I will not answer; They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me.",
			"29": "<sup>29</sup> Because they hated knowledge And did not choose the fear of the Lord,",
			"30": "<sup>30</sup> They would have none of my counsel And despised my every rebuke.",
			"31": "<sup>31</sup> Therefore they shall eat the fruit of their own way, And be filled to the full with their own fancies.",
			"32": "<sup>32</sup> For the turning away of the simple will slay them, And the complacency of fools will destroy them;",
			"33": "<sup>33</sup> But whoever listens to me will dwell safely, And will be secure, without fear of evil.”"

			"17": "<sup>17</sup> Her ways are ways of pleasantness, And all her paths are peace.",
			"18": "<sup>18</sup> She is  a tree of life to those who take hold of her, And happy are  all who retain her.",
