Philip’s help was required for the Ethiopian to have a better understanding of what he had just read. Such story shows us that reading the Bible and not understanding it is not something new. So, it is thought to be necessary to follow some guidelines that the Bible itself gives us about how to correctly study the Scriptures.

What did he do to explain the Bible? He used the Bible itself! That’s right. He began with the prophet Isaiah and showed how everything fit perfectly in the greater story that points to Jesus. That is also how the citizens of Berea studied and comprehended the Bible. According to <a href=\"#\" class=\"versicle-trigger\" data-versicle=\"Acts1711\">Acts 17:11</a>, they compared Bible texts with other Bible texts. This same principle also appears in the Old Testament, when <a href=\"#\" class=\"versicle-trigger\" data-versicle=\"Isa2810\">Isaiah 28:10</a> says that “do” must be compared with “do” and “rule” with “rule”, being a “little here, a little there”. Therefore, portions of the Bible must be compared among themselves. \r\n\r\nBesides, the study of the Word of God requires a specific attitude from us so the study can be useful.
