Matthew says that Jesus healed two blind men in the proximities of Jericho and Mark says it was only one. Would this be a contradiction? Not necessarily. What probably happened is that Mark wanted to highlight the experience of one of the blind men and ended up omitting the other one. \r\n\r\nIn order to avoid this feeling of contradiction, the Bible needs to be examined in its context, because its stories are complimentary. Other factors that are beyond what it is written in its pages must be taken into consideration.

Luke says that the healing took place when Jesus was going into the city, while the other Gospel writers say it happened when He left the city. There are a few ways to reconcile these accounts. One of them is considering the cultural fact that there were two cities of Jericho, an old and a new one, which allows for the fact that Jesus could be healing at the entrance of one and, at the same time, at the end of another. \r\n\r\nAs like in the previous example, the Bible is filled with repeated stories. That is, different authors wrote in the same way about the same event. Nowadays we call this plagiarism, which is even considered a crime.
